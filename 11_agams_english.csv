◙ Something about This Publication ◙ 
 
 We have already published 45 Aagams in Four languages--
Prakrut, Sanskrut, Hindi and Gujarati.  Now a day for new generation & 
abroad living people, English translation has become a necessity.  So 
we have planned to translate or compile Jain-Aagam in English. We 
gave priority to ‘Nandi Sootra’.  
 
After that we have worked for ‘Niryaavalika panchak’. Thus six 
Aagam have been completed. It is said that Nirayaavalik-aadi five 
Aagams are respectly Upang of Upaasakdas-aadi five ANG-Sootra. So 
we thaught to compile these Angsootras and as a result of that, 
Vipakshrut &Anuttaropapaatikdashais compiled; now we are going to 
present Ang sootra-8 ‘Antkrut-dasha’before you. During this translation 
of these three Ang-sootras one Prakirnak named ‘VEERSTAVA’ is also 
translated in to English. 
 
ANTAKRUD-DASHA is an “Ang-Pavitth” Aagam, Nandi Sootra & 
SuyagadangSootra Narrates ‘Antakrud-dasha’ as aeighth Ang-Sootra of 
Aagam. AbhaydevSuri has written Vrutti [commentary] on this sootra. 
Here, we have compiled Translation done by Surendra Bothara, 
which is originally edited in to Hindi by Shree Amar-Muni & Shree 
Chandra Surana, We have  two motives for publishing this book.—[1] To 
provide Aagam literature in English & [2] It should be given in Microsoft 
Word format so people can do Cut, Paste & Editing by themselves also. 
At present this Book is published as a Net-Publication with the 
help of the Jain Education International organization of America.  In 
future we may publish it as a Book also. We are also planning to put 
more Aagams in English before you. 
We also invite learned persons to translate more & more 
‘authentic Jain literature in English for kids and youths, so the ignorant-
people of regional languages can also read or learn our “Shashtra 
&Granth”. 
We are very much thankful to Shree Pravinbhai, Sudeshbhai, 
Late Mr. Krupal Shah and all other known-unknown persons who helpd 
us for this project directly or indirectly.

Preamble:- 
The Eighth Anga of Dwadasangi (twelve parts of Jain holy scriptures and 
canons) named Antakrud-dasha sutra begins in question-answer style. 
Arya Sudharma-Swami is staying in Prunabhadra temple of Campa city. 
Jambu Swami courteously asks him that ShramanaBhagavana Mahavira has 
described what facts and matter in Eighth Anga-Antakrud-dasha 'Sutra. In reply 
Ganadhara Sudharma Swami describes the contents of Eighth anga. 
In this Eighth Anga, there are eight sections or divisions and ninety chapters. 
From first to fifth sections, there are fiftyone (51) chapters. These chapters contain 
the description of fortyone (41) princes and ten (10) queens, relating to the royal 
family of Vasudeva Shrikrushna. All this description of consecration, austerities, 
practising of self-control and restrain is very heart-throbing and titillatory. 
All these practisers took place during the period of Bhagavana Ariitanerni. 
Sixth, seventh and eighth divisions or sections include titillatory description 
regarding the propiliation of pure conduct and austerities of sixteen (16) male (men) 
and twentythree (23) female (women) propitiators during the period of Bhagavana 
Mahavira. 
As thus, in the ninety chapters of eight sections or divisions, there is the 
description of 57 men and 33 women. All ninety self-practisers who attained 
salvation, by practicing pure propiliation of right knowledge, faith, conduct and 
austerity; so ending the circle of births and deaths, in that very existence-therefore 
those are called antakrud (end-doers). 
 
 
 
[1…] Meaning-  
-At that time and at that period there was a city, named Campa. That city was 
very beautiful and so describable. 
In the middle of north-eastern direction (Ishana kona) of the Campa city, there 
was a garden named Prunabhadra, which was very beautiful, heart-attracting and 
pleasure giving; so it was describable. Amidst that garden in the middle of north-
eastern direction, there was a sanctuary (temple) of a Yaksa (deity) named 
Piirttabhadra. 
In the city Campa at that period, a great king named Konika ruled, who was a 
very brave and great warrior. He was unconquerable like the great mountain 
Himavanta and saviour of his nation (the territory of which he was ruler).

Here in the clause 'tenam kalenamtenam samayenam' the words kala and 
Samaya are used in different meanings. The word ‘kala’ here denotes - the fourth

division (aaraa) of present avasarpini age; and word samaya is used for the period 
when the description is taking place. It means when Bhagavana Mahavira and 
Ganadhara Sudharma were present or were in existence. Thus the meanings of kala 
and samaya are different. 
Campa city was one of the beautiful cities of India at that time. Beauty and 
enrichment of this city is vividly described in Aupapatika sutra. It was the capital of 
Anga desha. But after the death of king Srenika, his son king Konika made this city 
his capital, leaving the city Rajagruha. Nirayavalika Sutra describes the episode like 
this--- 
The ruler of Magadha country, king Shrenika became very old. Among all his 
sons, Ashokacandra Konika, was eldest, brave and ambitious. His name was 
Ashokachandra; but his small finger was damaged (Kuni). So his Konika name 
became familiar.  
King Shrenika gave two invaluable things of kingdom to his two younger sons 
Halla-Vihalla, one was god-given necklace (Devanami hara) and the other was 
elephant Senchanaka. It angried prince Konika. Inspired by eager ambition to fetch 
the throne, he conspired along with his ten other brothers and imprisoned king 
Shrenika. He himself became the ruler of entire Magadha country, and gave small 
territories to his ten brothers. 
Being coronated and adorned with the signs of kingship Konika came to his 
adorable mother Chelana to bow down at her feet; but seeing the son coming, the 
mother turned her face to other side. Konika said-""O mother!Are you not happy 
seeing your son as a king?” 
Queen Chelana angrily rebuked-""The most affectionate father, without caring 
for his own life, gave the life to his son due to hearty affection; the same son, 
becoming greedy of kingdom, imprisons his own father, encages him and himself 
becomes king; which mother will like to see the face of such father-torturing son?"" 
Listening the agony-hearted words of mother, the heart of Konika grieved. He 
asked with curiosity-""How did father give me life? Did he really love me?” 
Chelana said-such a deep affection to a son can be found in the hearts of 
some fathers only. If you want to know, then listen. When you were in my womb then 
a hateful but keen desire engrossed me that I must eat the flesh of the heart of your 
father. I could not express such a hateful desire; but grief overtook me. Anyhow your 
father could know the cause of my grief. Then with courage and cleverness he 
fulfilled my that hateful desire. 
At the moment of your birth, I was filled with hateful thoughts about you that 
what's the use to give birth to a father-torturing son like you? I had you thrown in a 
dustbin by my maid slave. There a cock cut your little finger assuming you as a lump 
of flesh. But as soon as your father became aware of this episode, he rebuked me, 
went and brought you from the dustbin, and nurtured you with enormous love. Your 
damaged finger became septic. Due to pus you bitterly weep in the night. Then 
yourfather sucked the pus of your finger by his own mouth and vomited (threw) it. In 
this way, he used to subside your pain. 
Expressing all this eyes of Chelana became wet. 
Hearing such an episode from mother, Konika wept bitterly due to repentance. 
He ran to prison, taking an axe in his hand, to cut the chains and fetters of his father. 
Seeing Konika coming, with an axe in his hand, king Srenika thought-this 
kingdom-greedy, stupid son is coming to kill me. So it would be better that I myself

die than to die such a cruel death. Thinking thus, he gave up his life by sucking and 
crushing the diamond studded in his ring. 
Due to the death of the father, Konika was engrossed with great grief. He 
wept bitterly remembering his father. For many a days he was drowned in sorrow. 
While walking in park etc., sorrow lessened but as he sat on the throne he became 
sorrowful in the memory of his late father. (Nirayavalika sritra) 
For relief of this great sorrow, in the end according to the council of his 
ministers he left Rajagrha and made Campo city as his capital. 
Although king Konika, due to his lustfulness for kingdom, had done a most 
shameful deed-imprisoning his father; but afterwards by the advice and 
admonishment of his mother, he repented much and was filled with feelings of 
respect towards his parents. 
Thereby he is called courteous to his parents in fain Agamas. He was also a 
great devotee of Bhagavana Mahavira. 
Aupapatika sutra describes that king Konika had appointed a person, entitled 
PravrttiWiduka, on an enormous salary. There were many servants under him, their 
duty was to collect information about Bhagavana Mahavira; and that pravrtti Vaduka 
used to give full report about Bhagavana Mahavira to kingKonika every morning. 
The commentator of Aupapatika sutra, discussing the great personality of 
king, has described that a king must have five special characterstics like the great 
mountain Himavana. 
As mountain Himavana confines the boundary limit of Bharatakshetra, so a 
ruler saves the boundary of his territory. 
As the mountain saves the territory from external enemies, so the king saves 
country from external invasions. 
As the mountain is the treasure of herbs, roots etc., so the ruler should he full 
of virtues like-forgiveness, valour, generosity, charity etc. 
As the mountain remains stable in storms and hurricanes, so the ruler 
remains steadfast in his policy-rules and regulations. 
As the mountain is the base or support for all living beings, so is the ruler for 
his public. 
Konika was like the father of his subject, saviour, peace-giver and always 
beneficial for all. 
Arya Jambu accepted consecration from Sudharma Swami, when he (jambu) 
was of 16 years of age and after salvation of Bhagavana Mahavira. Twelve years 
after the salvation of Bhagavana Mahavira, Arya Suclharma became omniscient. 
This episode of teaching the Agamas should be of the time when the age of, jambu 
Swami was between 24-28 years. 
Antevaasi-a disciple who lives always near to his preacher, or a favorite 
disciple of a teacher. 
[…1] Meaning-  
At that time and at that period, elder sage (sthavira) Arya Sudharmd Swami 
with his five hundred mendicant disciples, according to the sage rules, wandering 
from village to village happily came to Purnabhadra garden ofCampa city. 
Knowing about arrival of Ganadhara Sudharma Swami, the citizens full of faith 
came to bow down to himand to listen his religious sermon. Ganadhara Sudharma 
gave religious sermon to present congregation. Listening that sermon.many persons 
accepted vows of renunciation and expiation and afterwards went back to their houses.

At that time and at that period, the favourite or alwaysliving near disciple of 
Sudharma Swami, after the departure of the congregation, Arya Jambu 
courteouslybowing down asked-0 Bhagawan!The beginner (propagator) of religion 
ShramanaBhagavana Mahavira Swami described this subject matter of seventh 
Afigasntra, then 0 Bhagawan! What subject matter he described in theEighth 
Angasutra- Anta-kruddasha Sutra? 
[…1] Commentary: - 
In thissutra the words `Java' and `vannao' are used many times and will be 
used further. These words are used in many sutras. Meanings of both the wordsare 
as follows- 
Java means ‘yavat'-until, upto that definite point. By this word it is pointed out 
that the detailed reading and vivid description of this very subject has been done 
elsewhere-the other sutra or sutras that should also be conceived here. At this very 
point, according to reference. 
The word 'Vannao' used for throwing light on various specialities of related 
reference and subject matter. There are many describable things, their features and 
qualities are also many. As the descriptions of city, mountain, garden, park, king etc., 
are vividly made at some particular places in sutra or sutras that should not be 
repeated over and again. For this purpose word Vanno (descriptive or describable) is 
used. It also points out that the reader should conceive the entire subject related and 
referred at the very point. The detailed description of Campa city and Prunabhadra 
chaitya we get in Aupapatika Sutra. 
Parisa niggaya Java- Here ‘java’ word indicates many kinds ofcongregations, 
many purposes of their coming, the knowledge of soul etc., elements, consecration, 
accepting house holder's vows etc., and various subjects like this should be known 
from Aupapatika sutra. 
Suhamme there java- Here the word `Java' indicates to conceive alland all 
about Sudharma Swami. In, Jnata-dharma-kathanga Sutra, chapter 1, the full and 
vivid description of the personality and personal traits of Sudharma-Swami has been 
given in a very lucid style.  
Here the word sthavira (elder sage) is used for Sudharma Swami. Sudharma 
Swami accepted consecration when he was 50 years of age, and remained upto 30 
years in the service of Bhagavana Mahavira. This episode is narrated after the 
salvation of Bhagavana Mahavira. Therefore at this time the age of Sudharma 
Swami should be more than eighty years. 
The word sthavira (elder sage) means the sage who himself remains stable in 
religion and religious rites and rules and should be capable to make others also 
stable in religion and sage activities. 
Three types of elder sages are described in Agamas. 
Vaya sthavira (Elder by age)-He must be at least sixty years of age. 
Diksha sthavira (Elder by consecration)-He must have been consecrated at 
least twenty years before. 
Shrut thavira (Elder by knowledge)-He must know the meaning of Sthananga 
and Samavayanga. 
Arya Sudharma was elder sage by all the aforesaid three points of view. 
‘Arya’-in ancient times the word ‘Arya’ was an address denoting honourable, 
Superior etc. This address was frequently used for the learned persons and persons 
Opulent with rectitude.

We get the word Arya (Prakruta form Ajja) used for Ganadhara Sudharma, 
Jambu and later preachers in Agamas and later literature. 
In Jain tradition the word ‘Bhante’ is frequently used for religious teachers, 
preachers and authentic persons. The word ‘Bhante’ has many renderings, like-
opulated with the high virtues of right knowledge, faith, conduct etc., or Bhavanta-
destructor of the cycle of births and deaths. This meaning should also be conceived 
by the word Bhagavana.

SudharmaSwami-Definitely Jambu! Shramana Bhagavan Mahavira,who has 
attained salvation, described eight sectionsOr divisions of Antakrud-dasha. 
Jambu! -Bhagavan! If, Shramana Bhagavana Mahavira has described eight 
sections or divisions of Antakrud-dasha, then how many chapters he has described

Arya Jambu- Bhagawan! If Shramana BhagavanaMahavira has expressed 
ten chapters of first section of eighth Anga Antakrud-dasha sutra, like Gautama etc., 
then 0 Bhagawan! What subject matter has Bhagavana MahavTra told in first 
chapter? Which type of description has he made? 
Arya Sudharma- Jambu! Definitely that description is like this-- 
At that time and at that period there was a city namedDwaraka (Baravai). It 
was twelve Yojana long and nine Yojana broad. It was built by the imaginative 
intellect ofVaishramana (Kubera-the god of wealth). It had ramparts of gold and 
adorned by turrets studded by five kinds of gems-Indra, Nila, Vaidurya, Padma and 
Raga. It was beautiful, as Alaknpuri-the city of god of wealth. There were numerous 
places of sports and pastime, rejoicings, amusements etc.  
On account of these, it was heart-pleasinglike heaven and worth-seeing. It 
was abhirupa-seeing once inspires the desire of seeing over and again; 
andpratirupa-whenever visualised seemed newly adorned, that is, it was adorned in 
such a peculiar style that whenever seen from any corner and any way a new 
reflection of adornment came into view. 
[3…] Commentary: - 
As it is expressed in previous pages that the description of 51 propiliators has 
been given in former five sections, these all were related to Dwaraka city and the 
royal family of Vasudeva Shree Krushna. Hence first of all, the description of 
Dwaraka city has been given. 
Dwaraka- it is the most popular city in History and literature of India. It was 
most beautiful and wealthy city. How and why it was built, the following popular 
episode makes it clear to understand easily. 
When Shree Krushna murdered the cruel and tyrant ruler of Mathura city, 
named Kansa, then the wife of Kansa-Jivayasha went to her father jarasandha, who

was anti-Vasudeva and ruler of Rajagruha (really monarch of southern half of Indian 
penunsula). Weeping bitterly Jivayasha expressed the whole happenings and 
murder of her husband Kansa, to her mighty father Jarasandha.  
Listening all this Jarasandha became red in fury. He sent his ambassador to 
Soriypura-ruler-Samudravijaya (Samudravijaya was the great father of Krushna and 
Balarama; because the father of Krushna and Balarama-Vastudeva was the 
youngest brother of Samudravijaya. Krushna Balarama both went to Soriypura after 
killing Kansa). 
Ambassador came to the court of Samudravijaya and spoke in harsh Words-
Samudravijaya! Either you send Krushna-Balararna with me at once or my lord 
Jarasandha will destroy you, your city and all Yadavas exhaustively. 
The harsh words were intolerable to Krushna. He disgraced the ambassador 
and the ambassador returned back angrily. 
Samudravijaya called a meeting of his kiths and kins, ministers and royal 
astrologers and then asked- whatshould be done in present circumstances? 
Premier Astrologer told-Though in your family there are three highly great 
persons- Tirathathkara Aristhanemi, Vasudeva Krushna and Baladava Balarama, so 
none can harm you, may he he mighty like Yama; but this land (territory) is not 
favourable for Yadavas. So for avoiding the struggle and peacelessness of every 
day, you should leave this place and go to south-west direction with all your families 
and citizens. You please stop at the place, where Satyabhama, wife of Krushna, give 
the birth to a son. That land would be favourable to Yadavas and there you will 
prosper. 
According to the counsel of royal astrologer, Samudravijaya, Vasudeva, 
Krushna, Balarama etc., whole Yadava family and citizens went out from Soriyapura 
and approached the south-west coast of ocean (Lavana samudra;) Here all 
encamped near Raivataka mountain. At that place Satyabhama gave birth to two 
sons- Bhanu and Bhramara. Yadavas decided to establish their capital at that very 
place. Observing three days' fast shree Krushna called a deity. Susthita deity came. 
Vasudeva expressed his desire- please; construct a new city for me. Deity went to 
his ruler-lndra and gave words to the desire of Krushna. Indra ordered Vaishraman-  
Kubera (god of wealth) to construct a very beautiful, heart-pleasing great and vast 
city for Vasudev Shree Krushna. 
Kubera constructed a vast and grand city which was twelve yojanas in length 
and nine yojanas in breadth. In this city there were many great and small gates, so it 
was named as Dwaraka. 
Some scholars opine that in this city there were twelve rulers (chief admini-
strators- ten Dasarhas Shree Krushna and Balaram, so it is called Barapati, which 
laterly became Dwarapati, Baravai and finally Dwaraka. 
The meanings of four adjectives Pasadiya etc., are as under-- 
Pasadiya-By seeing which the feeling of pleasure arises, Darisaniya- worth-
seeing, Abhiruva-Desire for seeing which arouses again and again, Padiruva- 
Whenever seen it looked new, nice and splendid. 
[…3] Meaning-  
Out of Dwaraka city in the middle of East-North directions (Ishan Kona) there 
was a mountain named Raivataka. On Raivataka mountain there was a garden, 
named Nandanavana. In that Nandanavana there was a temple (sanctuary) of 
Surapriya Yaka (deity) which was very old. That garden was surrounded by one vast

Vanakhanda, and in that Vanakhanda, there was a huge Ashoka tree. 
Shree Krushna ruled over that Dwaraka city, which was great and high like 
mountain Mahahimavana. (More description about king and city should be known 
from Aupapatika sutra.) 
In Dwaraka city ten adorables (Das'a Dasarha) reside viz.Samudravijayaji etc. 
And there dwell Balarama etc., five great warriors, Pradyumna etc., three and half 
crores princes, sixty thousand great fighters among them Samba Kumara was the 
foremost, over fifty six thousand mighty men (army groups) among them foremost 
was Mahasena. Virasena etc., twentyone thousand brave-men, Ugrasena etc., 
sixteen thousand rulers and Rukmini (being foremost) etc., sixteen thousand queens 
dwell in Dwaraka city. Anangsena etc. thousands of prostitutes (harlots)-courtesans 
also live there. Besides these, other numerous ishvaras (having respectable post 
and position), citizens, sarthavahas (traders) etc., also live in this city. 
In this way with vast fortune, magnificence, mighty warriors, citizens, Dwaraka 
city was opulent. Shree Krushna Vasudeva ruled over this city and completes half of 
Bharat Kshetra (three parts of Bharata-Ksetra of jambudwipa). 
In Dwaraka city ruler Andhakavrushni inhabited. He was great like Himawana 
Mountain. Dharini was his queen. 
Once Dharini was sleeping on a very comfortable bed, (such a bed can be 
available to meritorious persons- ‘tansi tarisagansi’) in her bedroom. (Its description 
should be understood from the episode of Mahabala. As- 
[4] Meaning-  
Queen Dharni's seeing dream of a lion, expressing her dream to her husband, 
babybirth, funs of baby, studies of arts etc., young age, marriage with beautiful and 
cultured maidens, residing in a comfortable and pleasant palace, and enjoyment of 
worldly pleasures etc. All the description should he conceived here like Mahabala. 
[5] Meaning-  
Here mentionable speciality is- that name of baby was kept Gautama Kumara. 
He married eight princesses in one day and he got eight crore gold-coins from his 
fathers-in-law as dowry (daaya), 
At that time, at that period Arahanta Arishthanemiwandering village to village 
came to Nandana garden ofDwaraka city, religious council (samavasarana) held.  
Bhavanapati, Vanavyantara, Jyotiska Vaimanika- all the four kinds of gods came to 
see and bow down to Bhagavana. Vasudeva Shree krushna also came with 
thousands of people, to see and bow down to him. 
Then, Gautamakumara also came out of his palace, for seeing and bowing 
down to Bhagavana like Meghakumara. Hearing and taking to heart the sermon of 
Bhagavana, he requested him- Reverend Sir (Devanupriya-beloved of gods) asking 
permission from my parents, I want to accept consecration near your lotus feet. 
Thus, like Meghakumara, Gantamakumara also asked permission from his 
parents. In the end Gautama kumara accepted consecration with great pomp and 
show. He accepted five circumspections (Samiti) as circumspection of movement 
(Iryaa samiti) etc. and three incognitoes (gupti) and began to wander according to 
the discipline of Bhagavana, i.e., Jain religious monk order. 
There after friar (anagara) Gautama learnt Samayika etc., eleven angas from 
the elder monks of Bhagavana Arishthanemi. After it observing many types of fast 
penances, like one day’s,  two days',  three days' fast penences  etc., and by other--

types of austerities purifying his soul Gautama ascetic reserved himself in soul bliss. 
Then on another day Arihanta Arishthanemi went out from Nandana garden of 
Dwaraka city and began to wander village to village telling the path of salvation to 
other souls- beings. 
Thereafter on an other day ascetic Gautama came to Bhagavana Arishtha-
Nemi, circumabulated three times, worshipped& bowed down himself with devotion, 
then respectfully expressed his wish- ""Bhagawan! If you allow me, I want to observe 
one month Bhiksu Pratima. 
(Arthanta Arishthanemi said- Beloved of gods (Devanupriya)! Do as you feel 
happy, but do not delay in meritorious deeds). 
Thus Gautama ascetic observed twelve Bhikshu Pratimas like Skandhaka 
monk and practised Gunaratna samvatsara penance.  
Practising penances and austerities, ascetic Gautama also thought like monk 
Skandaka and then with elder saints climbed up on Satrunjaya Mountain. There he 
searched a place without flora and insects, i.e., pure place. He made it neat and 
clean. After that with pure heart and steady propiliation, he accepted one month's 
fast penance (Sanlekhanaa-Really it is a penance till death). 
Thus with sathlekhana and fulfilling twelve years' consecration period and 
obtaining infinite knowledge, consuming all karmas he attained liberation. 
[6] Meaning-  
Arya Sudharm- Jambu! Thus ShramanaBhagavana Mahavira has expressed 
the subject matter of first chapter of first section of Antakrud-dasha sutra. 
Thus, as the description of ascetic Gautama has been given, in the same way 
the description of other 9 chapters should he known and understood. Father of all 
these was Andhakvrushni and mother was queen Dharini; but the names of Kumaras 
were- (2) Samudra Kumara, (3) Sagara Kumara (4) Gambhira Kumara (5) Stimita 
Kumara, (6) AchalaKumara, (7) KampilyaKumara (8) AkshobhaKumara (9) Prasena- 
jita, and (10) Vishnu Kumara. 
The subject matter of all these chapters is like monk Gautama. Thus these ten 
chapters are said. 
Commentary: - 
Special Resolution of Monk (Bhikshu Pratima)- Ascetic Gautama had 
practised 12 Bhikshu Pratimas (Special resolution of a monk) like great monk 
Skandaka. The conception of Bhikshu Pratimas is as following- 
The practiser of first Bhiksu pratima- takes one datti of food and one datti of 
water till one month. The regular flow of food and water, which is being given by a 
giver, is termed as datti.From first to seven Pratimas, the time-period of every 
following pratima increases by one month, As the period of first pratima is one 
month, second of two months, third of three months, fourth of four months, fifth of 
five months, sixth of six months and seventh of seven months. 
Likewise the number of dattis also increases. As during first Pratima the sage 
accepts one datti of food and one datti of water, in second two dattis of food and two 
dattis of water, in third three dattis, in fourth four dattis, in fifth five dattis, in sixth six 
dattis and in seventh seven dattis of food and water the sage accepts. 
The time period of eighth pratima is of seven days and nights and so is the case with 
ninth & tenth pratimas. All these eighth, nineth, tenth pratimas are practiced 
Observing complete fast, not even to take water on alternate days.   I.e. on first, third

Gunaratna Sathvatsara Tapa (Penance):-  
Gunaratna penance completes in 16 months. Among them 407 days are of 
fast and 73 days are of Paaranaa (to take food). During first month one day fast and 
second day Paaranaa this order is followed. In second month two days' fast and third 
day Paaranaa, in third month three days' fast and one day Paaranaa. Increasing in 
this way in 16th month Paaranaa is taken after sixteen days' fast. In this penance

►Thinking like Skandhaka:- 
Skandhaka was a great sage in Jain Sutras. His thinking was very deep and 
famous. So the simile of Gautama mendicant is given to Skandhaka sage. 
Once, on a night during religious awakening monk Gautama began to think 
like this-Due to different types of severe penances my body has become lean and 
withered and strength of body hase also diminished. Only by self-strength I stand 
and move. While I stand or move my bones crackle and make sound. Until I have 
strength, valour, etc., it would be better for me that I should propitiate the religious 
rites which are practised at the end of life. So in the morning I will go to Bhagavana 
and by bowing down worship him, myself propitiating five great vows, begging 
pardon of all saints and nuns, climbing on the mount Shatrunjaya with elder sages, 
watch a rock, taking bed of grass, making my own soul faultless by samlekhana, and 
renouncing food and water, lying like a broken branch of a tree (Padapopa-gamana 
santhara) and should remain steadfast in it. This is thebest for me.

Bhagavana Mahavira ofthe second section of Eighth Anga Antakrud-dasha, please 
tell me what ShramanaBhagavanaMahavira told in third section of this Anga. 
Sudharma Swami- Jambu! ShramanaBhagavana Mahavira has described 
thirteen chapters in the third section of Eighth Anga Antakrud-dasha Sutra, which are 
as follows- 
 (1) Anikasena, (2) Anantasena, (3) Ajitasena, (4) Anihataripu, (5) Devasena,

kupaka, (12) Daruka and (13) Anaadhrusti. 
Arya Jambu-Reverend Sir! If ShramanaBhagavanaMahavira has said 13 
chapters in the third section ofEighth Anga Antakrud-Dasha, then what description 
he has given of first chapter. 
 
 
Sudharma Swami- Jambu! At that time, at that period, there was a city named 
Bhaddilapura. That had many characterstics like great cities, opulated with wealth& 
agriculture products, gardens and parks, buildings and palaces and free from fear. 
So it was describable. 
Out of that city Bhaddilapttra, in its north-east direction, there was situated a 
garden (park) named Shrivan.The ruler of Bhaddilapura was king jitashatru. 
In that city lived Naaga Gaathapati (trader). He was wealthy and respected. 
He was not daunted by any task. 
Sulsa was the wife of Naga Gaathapati. She was beautiful and tender-bodied. 
She gave birth to a son named Anikasena. He was also beautiful and tender. He was 
nurtured by five foster mothers (dhatri mata). 
These were- (1) Foster mother-[who make him to drink milk], (2) Majjan 
dhatri-[bathing mother], (3) Mandana dhatri-[the mother who adorns him by clothes 
and ornaments], (4) Kridadhatri, [she was supporter to him in play], (5) Lap mother-
[who fondles him in her lap]. 
Anikasena was growing like Drejhapratijna Kumara, as the fragrant tree of 
campaka grows up without any hinderance in a cave of mountain and lonely place. 
Aupapatika Sutra vividly explains the description of Drdhapratijna Kumara.  
When Anikasena Kumara crossed the age of eight years then his parents sent 
him to an able teacher for education. He became at home in various arts and crafts 
and branchesof learning and along with he became adolescent and capable to enjoy 
worldly pleasures. 
Then knowing this state his parents married him with thirty two richmen's 
daughters in only one day. The maidens were like him, in age, colour, beauty, charm 
and youth. 
After marriage, Naga Gaathapati gave such a present (Pritidaana) to his son 
Anikasena Kumara, as thirty two crores silver and gold (coins) etc. Its description 
should be known like Mahabala (until) time of Anikasena was passing pleasurefully 
with sweet recitation of songs and orchestra-[musical instruments etc].

At that time, at that period wandering village to village Arihanta Arishthanemi 
came to Bhaddilapura, stayed at shrivana garden with due consent about every 
necessary thing. Congregation assembled for hearing his sermon. Anikasena 
Kumara also came to know about coming of Bhagavana. While he saw the people 
going to bow down to Bhagavana, his desire also aroused. Like Gautama Kumara, 
Anikasena Kumara also approached to the religious assembly, and heard sermon. 
Thereaftertaking the permission of parents, he accepted the consecration at the lotus 
feet of Bhagavana. 
Speciality from Gautama Kumara is this-that Anikasena Kumara learned 
Samayika etc., eleven Angas and fourteen Purvas, practised shramanahood upto 20 
years. Remaining account is the same, he climbed upon mountain Shatrunjaya and 
liberated after the samlekhana of one month. 
Thus 0 Jambu! ShramanaBhagavana Mahavira has described the subject 
matter of first chapter of third section of Eighth Anga Antakrud-dasha. 
Commentary: - 
Pritidaana-At any occasion of pleasure, the prize or present given wilfully and 
with happiness, was famous by the term pritidaana in ancient times. It is to be taken 
into consideration that the wealth given by relatives of bride to bridegroom which is 
now called dowry, in the ancient times it was called daaya. In the episode of 
Gautama Kumara the word daaya is used; but here is the word pritidaana and it is

[13…] Meaning-  
Arya Jambu- Reverend Sir! I have heard the subject matter of seventh 
chapter. Now, please tell me what description of eighth chapter has been given by 
Shramana Bhagavana Mahavira. 
Arya Sudharma- Jambu! At that time, at that period, there was a city named 
Dwaraka.[The description of city should be known from first chapter of first section,] until, 
Arihanta Arishthanemi Bhagwana came. 
At that time, at that period six uterine brothers were disciples of 
BhagavanaArishthanemi, who lived nearhim. All these six were alike in colour, 
structure,ageand configuration; differentiation was very difficult among them. Their 
colour was blue, like blue lotus, horn of a buffalo. There was the mark of Shrivatsa 
on chest of every one. Their hairs were soft, curly and conjusted. These all were as 
beautiful as Nalakubera.[Nalakubera means very beautiful son of vaishraman (god of 
wealth)].  
As all these accepted consecration, became houseless mendicant renouncing 
house-holders' code, the very day all these approached Arihanta Arishthanemi and 
bowing worshipping him spoke these words- 
Bhagawan! With your consent we wish that till life we practise two days' fast 
penance and third day take food. Thus observing austerity and fixing ourselves in 
soul virtues, we wish to move in your religious order. 
Bhagavana said-0 beloved as gods! Do, as you feel happy; but do not delay 
or be not careless in meritorious deeds. 
Then getting the consent of Bhagavana Ariytanemi, all these six monks began 
to wander village to village, with the religious congregation observing two days' fast 
penance and third day to take food (Bele-Bele fast penance) for whole life. 
Thereafter at any day of Paranaa (the day of taking food) after two days' fast 
penance all these six monks studied in the first three hours (first prahara) of day and 
after that approached Bhagavana, like Gautama Swami and spoke thus unto him. 
Bhagawan! We all six monks want to wander in Dwaraka city, in three groups 
(containing two in each group) for seeking food as the paranna of two days' fast 
penance with your consent. 
Bhagavana said- Beloved as gods! Do, as you feel happy.Then getting the 
consent all the six monks bowed down and worshipped Arihanta Aritshthanemi. After 
it, from there, these monks went out and reached Sahasraamravan (the wood of 
mango trees). Going out of that wood they divided themselves in three groups of two 
monks. Then they began to wander in the city with peaceful mind and observing 
circumspection of movement. 
One of those three groups wandering in Dwaraka city seeking alms from high-
low-medium standard houses, from one to the other house, approached the palace 
of Devaki, the queen of king Vasudeva. 
Queen Devaki became very glad, happy and filled with bliss, seeing the two 
monks coming to her palace. Due to affection her mind filled with joy, her heart 
bloomed like a lotus due to the extremity of happiness.

Standing up from her seat queen Devaki went towards monk couple, seven or 
eight steps with pleasureful heart, circumambulated bowed down and worshipped 
them. Then she went to kitchen with monk-couple. There she put Sinh-Keshar 
Modaka (a kind of too much fragrant and nourishing-vitalising sweetball) in a big plate and 
gave to monk-couple. After this queen Devaki once again bowed down, worshipped 
and gave farewell to monk-couple. 
[13…] Commentary: - 
Jaha Goyama Sami Java ichchhamo…..All these six uterine brother monks 
wished to move like Gautama Swami. 
 (The method of seeking alms of Gautama Swami. we get in Bhagavati sutra sataka 
2, Uddeshaka 5.) Like him, all these six brother monks studied scriptures in the first 
prahara of the day, in second involved in meditation, in third peacefully watched 
cloths, ‘muhpatti’, utensils etc. Taking utensils- [patra] came to the lotus feet of 
Bhagavana and bowing down in due order asked the permission to wander in the 
city for seeking alms. Obtaining the permission began to wander in the city for 
seeking alms with peaceful mind and observing movement circumspection. 
Regarding high-medium-low standard people, the clarification of ancient 
sages-preachers, is like this-- 
High (standard)-The palaces of kings, rulers, powerful persons etc. 
Medium-Big houses of wealthy traders and rich persons. 
Low- One storyed houses, cottages of general public. 
Sages used to seek alms from all these three types of houses and persons 
without any differentiation. 
[…13] Meaning-  
This question of Devaki was answered by the sages in these words-beloved 
as gods! The position is not like this, that sages could not get food and water from 
high-low-middle-class houses of this city of Krshna Vasudeva, which is like heaven 
abode nor sages go over and again to same house' for their need of food and water. 
O beloved of gods!The fact is like this. We six are uterine brothers, sons of 
Naga Gathapati and his wife Sulasa, inhabitant of city Bhaddilapura. We all six 
(resembled) Nalakubera. We all six brothers heard sermon of Arihanta Arishthanemi, 
took it to heart and being frightened from the cycle of births and deaths-the world, we 
accepted consecration and are practising sagehood. 
The day we all six brothers accepted consecration, we bowed down and 
worshipped Arihanta Arishthanemi and expressed our utter wish in these words-""0 
Bhagawan! By your permission we wish to wander with you observing two days' fast 
penance (and third day to take food) (Bele-Bele tapasya) till life, thus purifying our 
souls."" 
Then Bhagavana permitting us said-""0 beloved as gods! Do as you feel 
happy; but do not delay. 
0 beloved as gods (Devaki)! Obtainingthe permission of Arihanta Arishtha-
nemi, we began to wander practising bele-bele austerity. 
Thus, today is the day of breaking fast of six meals, of all six brothers. During 
the first prahara (three hours) of day we studied scriptures and in second prahara 
meditated and in the third prahara taking the permission of Arihanta Arishthanemi, 
we made three groups of two monks each and wandering for seeking food and water 
in high-low-middle class houses of the city approached to your palace.

0 beloved as gods! It is not a fact that we are the monks who came to you in 
two former groups, but it is true that we are others.Those monks said such to Devaki 
and returned back in the direction they had come. 
Hearing this episode and after the departure of the sages, the mind of Devaki 
was engrossed by these thought currents. 
Once, in my childhood, in Polasapura city sage Atiinukta foretold about me 
that Devaki, the beloved as gods! You will give birth to eight sons; they will resemble 
each other and would be handsome like Nalakithara. In this Bharataksetra, no other 
mother will give birth to such sons. 
Has this forecast proved false to-day? It is clearly evident that other mothers 
have also given birth to such resembling sons. (But forecast of sage must not be wrong. 
Why this controversy before my eyes? During the up and down of thoughts) Devaki 
determined that I should go to Arihanta Arishthanemi,bow down and worship him 
and doing thus, ask about the forecast of sage Atimukta. Devaki thought like this and 
as such she called the family servants and ordered them-""Bring forth quickly the 
stately religious chariot (rather) with all equipments."" 
Family servants presented the chariot immediately. Queen Devaki sat in that 
chariot and approached the religious congregation of Arishthanemi. As we get the 
description of worshipping Bhagavana Mahavira, by Devanandaa in the same way 
Devaki began to worhip Arihanta Arishthanemi. 
[…13] Commentary: - 
1. The clause Aimuttenam Kumara Samanenenam here indicates the forecast 
of Atimukta Kumara-sage. The tale goes like this:-- 
Atimukta Kumara-sage was the younger brother of Kamsa. When the wife of 
Kamsa, Jivayasaa was making amusements with Devaki (the younger sister-in-law) at 
that time Atimukta Kumara-sage reached the house of Jivayasaa forseeking food 
and water. Envolved in rejoicings Jivayasaa, saw Atimukt Kumara-sage, took in view 
the past relation of brother-in-law, and began to join She said-""Brother-in-law! You 
also come and participate in amusements at rejoicings,"" 
Then Atimukta Kumarr-sage! Now you are rejoicing with Devaki thinking 
yourself much fateful; but in future Devaki will give birth to eight sons. These sons 
would be such beautiful and fateful that no other woman in Bharat-Varsha (India) can 
produce such sons. But the seventh son of this Devaki will murder your husband and 
rule over half of Bharata-varsha (India). Devaki listened this fact in her childhood. For 
ascertaining this, queen Devaki decided to go to Bhagavana Arishthanemi.

approached Nandana-vanes. Seeing the felicitations of Bhagavana, she practised 
five Abhigamas and then reaching the religious assembly of Bhagavana bowed 
down to him in due order and began to praise and worship him. 
[…13] Meaning-  
Thereafter Arihanta Arishthanemi addressing queen Devaki spoke thus unto 
her-Devaki! Did such suspicion and thought arise in your mind that the forecast 
about you done by Atimukta Kumara-sage that you will give birth to eight matchless 
sons, proved false? In this regard, for asking and being sure, you have come quickly 
here. Is it correct?

Devaki accepted- Bhagawan! It is correct. 
Bhagavana Arishthanemi removing the doubt, began to speak-- 
0 beloved of gods!  At that time and at that period, a gathapati named Naga-- 
lived in Bhaddilapura. He was very rich. Sulasa was his wife. An astrologer told 
about Sulasa, when she was in childhood that this girl would give birth to deceased 
children, On account of this, Sulasa became the devotee of Harinegamesi god. 
Sulasa made an image of Harinegamesi god. Every morning she bathed, 
repented for ill-dreams and worshipped god by fragrant, beautiful flowers of great 
value, wearing the entire time drenched robe. After worship she fell on her knees 
and bowed down; then she used to do the work of household, food etc. 
The god was pleased with Sulasa by her such devotion, respect and service. 
On account of compassion for Sulasa 
Gathapatni god Harinegamesi menstruated both-you and her at same time. 
Then at the same time you and she become pregnant and both gave birth to 
sons at the same (after completing the pregnancy period of nine months) time. 
Then god liaritiagamesi-used to take the still (deceased) child of Sulasa and 
keep that beside you. 
0 beloved as gods! Like this the god carefully took your alive son and kept in 
the lap of Sulasa housewife. 
Devaki! Therefore, actually these six monks are your sons and not of Sulasa, 
Then Devaki Devi, listening the secret disclosed by Arihanta Arishthanemi, 
became glad. She bowed down, praised and worshipped him and reached the six 
monks and bowed down and worshipped them. 
Devaki gazed at those sages for a long time. Her heart filled with motherly 
affection. Her breasts began to milch. Due to joy her eyes streamed and filled with 
tears of happiness. Her body spread out so the binding threads of her brassiere 
broke up, her bracelets splitted on her arms, the root-cells of her hair swelled like 
kadamba flowers beaten by rain showers. She observed those six monks with 
unwinking eyes for a long time. Then Devaki brought herself to her senses and again 
bowed down to all the six sages. 
Thereafter she came to Arihanta Arishthanemi, circumam-bulating thrice she 
bowed down to him with devotion and went out of the religious assembly. 
She sat in her religious chariot, reached Dwaraka city and then her palace. 
Getting down from chariot she entered her bed-room and sat on her bed. 
[…13] Meaning-  
Then there arose such thinking, thought and mental current in the mind of 
Devaki- Oh truly I gave birth to seven sons exactly alike (until) resembling 
Nalakubera in beauty butI could not enjoy the childhood plays of even one of them. 
Even this Krushna comes to me after six months for reverence, but in hurry. 
In this world, really happy and fateful are those mothers, sons (child) horn from 
their own wombs, greedy for sucking milk of their breasts, lisping sweetly, babbling 
and pattling, moving to their armpits from where the breasts arose up, give a sitting 
in their laps having them by lotus-like hands, give sweet talks and pleasing words. 
Definitely, I am hapless, meritless and successless; because I have not even 
visualized the childhood plays of any one of my seven sons. 
Thus Devaki, putting her check on her palm, drowned in sorrowful thoughts 
with frustrated mind and hopes.

Thus Devaki was sitting sad-minded. At the same time ShreeKrushna 
vasudeva, bathed (until) decorated his body with clothes & ornaments, came quickly 
to motherDevaki for reverence of her feet. Then vasudeva Krushna saw and bowed 
down at the feet of Devaki. When he saw his mother sad and worried he enquired -- 
0 mothers! Formerly whenever I came to touch your feet, you always became 
glad on seeing me; but 0 mothertoday why are you sad, worried and brooding? What 
is itsreason? Please tell me. 
On this question Devaki began to say unto Krushna Vasudeva-O Son! Really 
the fact is this that I have given birth to seven sons exactly same in colour, form and 
body formation; but could not enjoy the childhood days and plays of any single son. 
You also come to me after 6 months for touching my feet. Hence I am thinking 
that those mothers are fateful, who feed their sons by their breasts, talk sweetly to 
them. I’m hapless, meritless. Pondering over all this, I’ sad, worried and brooding. 
[…13] Meaning-  
Hearing this expression and knowing desire of mother, Shree Krushna 
Vasudeva said-- mother! Do not be sad, worried and brood; I shall so strive that my 
uterine brother will take birth. 
Thus saying ShreeKrushna assured his mother Devaki with sweet, pleasing 
and agreeable words. 
Thus assuring his mother,Shree Krushna came out of the palace and reached 
oratory (Pauashashala). As Abhaya Kumara propitiated his god accepting three 
days' fast penance, in the same way Shreekrushna Vasudeva, accepting three days' 
fast penance began to propitiate god Harinegamesi. 
Having divine form & unique lustre god Harinegamesi, attracted by propiliation 
came and staying in sky became present before Krushna Vasudeva and spoke thus-
0 beloved ofgods! I am god Harinegamesi. Why you have called me by eight meals 
fast austesity. Attracted by your penance I am present before you. Tell me your 
desire, in which good deed of yours can I help you? What is your wish? 
Then krushna Vasudeva spoke to god with folded hands-0 beloved ofgods! 
My one uterine brother should take birth, it is my wish. 
[…13] Commentary: - 
Jahaa Abhao- Like Abhaya Kumara Shree Krushna Vasudeva propiliated god 
Harinegamesi and expressed his desire for a younger uterine brother. 
Description of Abhaya Kumara, we get in Jnatasutra, Chapter 1, regarding the 
episode of Megha kumara. An intense desire arose in the head and heart of mother 
(really step mother of Abhaya Kumara) Dharini. While she was pregnant, that I may 
enjoy rainy season but it was not according to time, because at that time summer 
was prevailing. For fulfilling the intense desire of pregnant Dharini, Abhaya Kumar 
propitiated a god who was residing in Saudharma heaven, but was friend of his 
(Abhaya Kumara's) former life.  
Method of propitiation is thus-Going to oratory (pausadhshala) accepted three 
days' fast penance, practising full celibacy done paushadha (a special vow), putting 
off all kinds of ornaments, spread a pallet-bed of grass. With eight meals fast putting 
mind in Harinegamesi god called him by heart. At the last day of three days' fast, 
seat of god moved. By clairvoyance he became aware of the fact, and then he came 
with fast speed and presented himself staying in sky, not touching the ground or 
remaining four fingers above from surface of earth.

[…13] Meaning-  
Thereafter Harinegamesi spoke such unto Shree Krushna Vasudeva-beloved 
ofgods! One god, completing his duration of celestial abode, will take birth as your 
younger brother, so your desire will be surely fulfilled. But passingboyhood, attaining 
young age being tonsured he will accept sagehoodnear Bhagavan Arishthnemi. 
The god said thus twice and thrice to Shree Krushna Vasudeva and then he 
went back to the same direction from which he had come. 
After that Krushna Vasudeva came out of oratory and reached mother Devaki. 
Touching her feet, he said-0 mother! My one uterine brother will surely be born. Your 
desires will he fulfilled. So you should not worry. Thus he assured mother Devaki by 
sweet and agreeable words, then went back to direction from which he had come.  
Then at any other time mother Devaki was sleeping on a luxurious (worth 
sleeping meritorious persons) bed, she saw a lion in dream. She woke up, came to king 
Vasudeva and told him her dream. Thus understanding fulfillment of desire definitely, 
she became glad and happily began to nurture the child in her womb with due care. 
Thereafter, on completion of nine month's pregnancy period, Devaki Devi 
gave birth to a son, having the beauty of a jasumina-flower, red Bandhujivaka flower, 
of lacpigment, best Parijataka flower, red like rising sun, eye-soothing to all persons, 
tender, with all developed senses, good shapeliness,tendu like an elephant's palate. 
The description of Gaja Sukumala (name of newly bornson of Devaki) should be 
known as of Megha Kumara. (Until) At the time of giving name, parents thought that 
our child is tender and beautiful like an elephant's palate, so its name should be Gaja 
Sukumala. Thinking thus the parents of the child gave him the name Gaja Sukumala. 
Remaining description should be known like MeghaKumara. In this way gradually 
Gala Sukumala became young and capable to enjoy worldly entertainments and 
rejoicings, pleasures.

Description of birth of Megha Kumara is as follows-- Like Dharini while intense

a beautiful son, whose birth ceremony should be known like Megha Kumara. In the

Slave-women, who gave information of baby-birth, were freed from slavery 
and huge wealth was given to them as gift etc. 
City was purified with fragrant water, prisoners were set free and weights and 
measures were increased. 
For ten days all the trades were announced tax-free. King lavishly gave 
charity the poor and orphans. Celebrations were held for ten days in the kingdom. 
On the twelth day king got food etc., prepared in huge quantity and celebrated 
the joyful ceremony eating with his friends, caste persons and state-servants. Then 
he honoured them by clothes and ornaments. Afterwards the parents spoke that our

child is tender and red like an elephant's palate, so its name should he Gaja 
Sukumala. Thus saying they gave name Gaja Sukumala to their son. 
[…13] Meaning-  
At that time in, Dwaraka city a brahmana dwelt, whose name was Somila? He 
was rich and well-versed in all the four Vedas-- Rugveda, Yajurveda, Atharvaveda& 
Samaveda; also knew the secrets of Yajna-Yaga and other rituals, sacrifices etc. 
His wife was Somasri. She was tender and beautiful. Soma was the daughter 
of Somila and Somasri. She was tender and extremely beautiful. She was very 
shapely and superbly beautiful. 
One day maiden Somaa bathed (until) adorned by clothes and ornaments, 
surrounded by Kubja, Cilaata etc., and slave maidens came out of house. Having set 
out she came to the highway. On the highway she began to play with a golden 
(binded by golden threads) ball. 
At that time and at that period Arihanta Arishthanemi came to Dwaraka, 
Congregation went out for listening his sermon. 
Heaving heard auspicious news of the coming of Bhagavana, Shreekrushna 
Vasudeva bathed and decked and rode an elephant with Gaja Sukumala Kumara. 
Shreekrushna was wearing garland of Kornta flowers and an umbrella on his head, 
white and best camaras were fanned on both his sides. Thus he was going through 
the centre of Dwaraka to bow down to Arishthnami. Then he saw Somaa playing on 
highway. He was wonder-struck seeing shape, youth, beauty etc., of maiden Soma. 
Then Vasudeva Krushna called the chamberlains going with him and ordered 
them-0 beloved ofgods! Go to Somila brahmana and beg this maiden Soma. Take 
hold of her and put her in the harem of maidens. At proper time, this maiden Somaa, 
would be the wife of my youngerbrother Gaja Sukumala. 
Then chamberlains obeying order of, shrikrushna went toSomila brahmana 
and asked for his daughter. Somila became very much glad and agreed to give away 
his daughter. Chamberlains took Soma from his father Somila and put her in harem. 
And then they said to Shree Krushna that your order has been fulfilled. 
Thereafter Krushna Vasudeva went through middle of Dwaraka and reached 
Sahasramra garden, practised five abhigamas and bowed down to Bhagavana and 
then sat at a proper place. 
Bhagavana Arishthanemi preached sermon to the congregation, premier were 
Gaja Sukumala and Shreekrushna.After hearing sermon of Bhagavana, returned 
back. 
Hearing the sermon of Bhagavana, Gaja Sukumala Kumara became adverse 
from world and worldly joys. Being engrossed by apathetic feelings, bowing down to 
Arishthanemi Bhagavana spoke-0 Bhagawan! I feel this doctrine very interesting, I 
love it, so I want to accept it. Taking permission from parents, I will accept Shramana 
hood from you. 
Like Megha Kumara, Gaja Sukumala saying thus to Bhagavana returned to 
his residence and expressed his own thoughts before his parents. Hearing 
aboutConsecration Devaki was filled with grief, firstly she swooned, afterwards came 
into senses and began to say, shedding her tears-0 son! You are too dear to us. We 
shall not be able to tolerate your separation. Still you are unmarried, so first of all you 
wed, and increase family-line and transferring your responsibilities to your sons, and 
then you accept consecration.

Vasudeva Krushna, after he became aware about apathy of Gaja Sukumala 
he came to him, embraced him, put him in his lap and said in very affectionate 
words- O beloved, as gods! You are my younger uterine brother. Hence I say that 
you should not accept consecration after tonsuring your head near Bhagavana 
Arishthanemi at this time. I shall anoint you with royal coronation in this city Dwaraka 
in a grand ceremony. 
[…13] Meaning-  
Gaja Sukumala remained silent hearing these words of Krushna Vasudeva. 
After some times Gaja Sukumala spoke twice and thrice to his elder brother Krushna 
Vasudeva and parents- 
O beloveds as gods! Really amusements and rejoicings of man and his body 
are impure, perishable and momentary. This body is filled with stool, urine, phlegm, 
vomit, semen, blood etc. the dirty things. This human body and the sensual 
pleasures related to it are unstable, with an end, and being perishable, these are to 
be exhausted either now or later. 
Therefore O beloveds as gods! I wish that permitted by you, I shall accept 
consecration (shramanahood) before Bhagavana Arishthanemi. 
When Krushna Vasudeva and his parents could not become capable of 
moulding Gaja Sukumala towards worldly enjoyments even by loving and agreeable 
expressions, then being disappointed unwillingly Krushna Vasudeva and his parents 
spoke thus unto him- 
“O son! If it is so, then we want to visualize you as a king (adorned with 
coronation) only for one day. So you accept kingship at least for a single day. 
At such insistence of parents and elder brother Gaja Sukumala remained 
silent. Assuming silence as acceptance with a great ceremony he was coroneted by 
108 pitchers of gold and silver etc. 
After enthronement of Gaja Sukumala parents asked- O son! Now what do 
you want? Tell, what is your wish? 
Gaja Sukumala answered- I want to be consecrated. 
Then according to the wish of Gaja Sukumala all the paraphernalia was 
provided. Sitting in the palanquin which is carried by one thousand persons Gaja 
Sukumala reached the religious assembly of Bhagavana Arishthanemi in great 
procession. Parents gave their son as pupil to Bhagavana.  
Gaja Sukumala put off all ornaments himself, tonsured his head by five fists 
and then requested to Bhagavana that O Bhante (Bhagawan)! Now, you yourself 
consecrate me; give me the robe of a sage and knowledge of conduct. Bhagavana 
preached him (GajaSukumala) seventy rules of conduct (Carana sattari) and seventy 
rules of activity (Karna sattari) and consecrated him. Now Gaja Sukumala became a 
houseless mendicant. Practising movement incognito (until) he became deep 
celebate of guarded in celibacy. 
[…13] Commentary: - 
(1) Detailed description of coronation we get in Rayapaseniya Sutra and that 
of consecration in Bhagawati Sutra in the episode of Mahabala. 
In the method of installing (abhisheka vidhi) the purified water mixed with all 
kinds of herbs is sprinkled on the head of a person with chanting mantras. In this the 
herb-mixed pure water is filled from seas, rivers etc. in 108 pitchers of gold, 108 
pitchers of silver and 108 pitchers of clay.

After the royal function or coronation, parents ask-Now what is your wish, tell 
us. Then Gaja Sukumala says-For me, ask for parapharnelia of consecration-duster 
(rajoharana) utensils (patra) from the shop Kutrikapana (a shop blessed by a god or 
deity, where every kind of goods is available. All the things of the world which are 
most difficult to get are also available in that shop. In modern days, it can be told as 
the biggest departmental store of the world.) And also call a barber. Then 
paraphernalia costing two lakhs golden coins and a barber for one lakh gold coin 
was asked. Then barber shaved the head of Gaja Sukumala by razor leaving only 
four angula fore-hairs. Mother Devaki took those shaven hairs in a white and neat 
cloth and then kept them in a box studded with gems with due care and said-These 
hair of my dear son would be useful for last visualization on the auspicious occasions 
days, festivals and celebrations. 
Acceptance of Special vow of Mahapratima-- 
[…13] Meaning-  
After consecration, Gaja Sukumala sage, in the first part of afternoon (thid 
prahara of day), the same day on which came into sage order, went out place where 
Arihanta Arishthanemi was thrice circumambulated and then spoke in polite words- 
O Bhagawan! On being permitted by you I want to abide observing the great 
vow-resolution (mahapratima) of one night in the cemetery (funeral place) Mahakala. 
Bhagavana said-O beloved of gods!Do as you feel happy. 
Thus being permitted by Arihanta Arishthanemi sage Gaja Sukumala bowed 
down and worshipped him and starting from there walked out of Sahasramra-vana 
and reached cemetery Mahakala. 
There he looked for clean spot free from flora and insects. After that he looked 
for clean spot for discharging stool and urine. Thereafter standing at a place, slightly 
bending forward his body (hanging both the hands upto knees), fixing eyes on a 
lump of matter (pudgala), contracting both legs (with the distance of four fingers 
between the heels and toes of both legs), accepting great firm resolution 
(Mahapratima) of one night went deep into meditation. 
Trouble (Upsarga) by Somila-- 
[…13] Meaning-  
Brahamana Somila for taking sacrificial wood went out of Dwaraka to the 
forest, before Gaja Sukumala reached the Mahakala funeral place. The way to forest 
passed near to the same funeral place. In the forest he collected sacrificial wood, 
grass, plucked up fore-part bent leaves and returned to the city-to his home. On 
returning passing by Mahakala cemetery at the time of evening twilight when the 
coming and going of men becomes rare, he saw monk Gaja Sukumala there 
standing in meditation. 
Seeing the monk, the enmity of former births awakened in the heart of Somila. 
He recollected the enmity of former births. By this remembrance he raged up in fury 
and murmured-Oh this is the same Gaja Sukumala desirous of undesirable-wisher of 
death, shameless and devoid of fortunes; who abandoning my matured, faultless 
daughter Soma (born from the womb of my wife Somasri) without any cause became 
an ascetic. 
[…13] Commentary: - 
Seeing monk Gaja Sukumala in meditation why the mind of Somila filled with 
such a ferocious anger? There may be many present and past causes of it. Present 
causes here clearly stated that his daughter Soma was to be wedded with him (Gaja  
Antakrud-Dasha- Ang-08 - varga-3, Chapter- 8 
 
 
 
 
 
                                                                                  [25] 
 
 
 
Aagam – 08 – Antakrud-dasha                                                       Compiled by - Deepratnasagar 
 
 
Sukumala). Vasudeva Shreekrushna asked and preserved her (Soma) in harem of 
maidens. When Gaja Sukumala accepted monkhood leaving that maiden then 
Somila raged in fury. 
The other past causes also pointed in Agama by words-‘tam veram sarai-
remembering the enmity’ and ‘anega bhava-saya sahassa sanciyam kammam 
udiremanenam-performing udirana of accumulated karmas of million former births’. 
In this context a story is popular about the former birth of Somila and Gaja 
Sukumala. The episode is this- 
The soul of Gaja Sukumala was a queen of a king in his innumerous former 
birth. That king had another queen also. That queen had given birth to a son so she 
became more beloved of that king. So the queen (soul of Gaja Sukumala) began to 
have feelings of detachment towards that other queen and have keen desire that her 
son myay die somehow. 
Per chance a boil took place in the son’s head. Child began to flounder due to 
agony. Step mother Isoul of Gaja Sukumala) said to the mother of that child that I 
know the treatment of this disease. The mother of child gave her son to step mother. 
Step mother binded hot horse-bean bread on the head of the child. Due to serious 
agony child floundered much and died. After a long-long period the soul of that child 
took birth as Somila and that of step mother as Gaja Sukumala. 
Veranubandhini mahabbhayani- The bondages of enmity are most ferocious. 
So by the remembrance of this former enmity Somila raged in fury, and for taking the 
revenge, his ill feelings aroused to take wet clay to make the raised up sides on the 
head of monk and to fill it with the burning coals of khair fuel. 
He had done such cruel deed due to former enmity 
[…13] Meaning-  
Therefore I should definitely take revenge from Gaja Sukumala-such ill-
feelings occupied the mind of Somila. He thought and after thinking he gazed at all 
directions upto far distance that whether any body was seeing him or not. Gazing all 
around he took moist clay from a nearby pond, came to the place where monk Gaja 
Sukumala was, putting that clay on the head of monk, raised it on all sides. 
After that he took burning coals from a pyre in a piece of clay pitcher and put 
up those burning coals on the head of monk Gaja Sukumala. Then being frightened 
(fear lest anyone may see him) sharply he stepped backward and (running from 
there) he (Somila) went to the direction from which he had come. 
Due to the burning embers kept on the head, most ferocious agony took place 
in the body of monk Gaja Sukumala that was much fiery, acute and untolerable. 
Even so, monk Gaja Sukumala bore it with even mind, not becoming wrathful 
towards brahamana Somila, even a bit. 
At that time, bearing such an acute painful, fiery, untolerable agony with calm 
and equanimous mind friar Gaja Sukumala entered the eighth stage of spiritual 
development stage-Apurwakarana by his auspicious thoughts and feelings, 
destroying the karmas which envelop soul-virtues. 
By it monk Gaja Sukumala attained infinite knowledge and perception. 
Thereafter his duration completed and he became perfected (until) and free of all 
miseries and pains. 
Thus by exhaustion (destruction) of all karmas houselss mendicant Gaja 
Sukumala became emancipated (who has nothing to do) omniscient-knower of every 
thing in Loka and Aloka, supreme calm (parinivritta)-being free from all karmas, and

becoming free from all mental and bodily pains he became free from all miseries 
(sarvadukha prahina). 
At that time the nearby gods knowing that-‘monk Gaja Sukumala has 
propiliated sage-order with supremity’ they rained the divine fragrant non-sensient 
water, showered divine non-sensient flowers of five colours and clothes and echoed 
the sky by celestial song and melody. 
[…13] Commentary: - 
Apuvvakarana-Apurvakarana- This word means- which is never attained 
before-realisation of the sublime feeling of this stage. It is also taken as the eighth 
spiritual development stage named as nivrtti badara gunasthana. Two steps begin 
from this stage- (1) Subduative step (upasama sreni) and (2) exhaustive step 
(kshapaka sreni).  
The mendicant who takes subduative step he stops reaching the eleventh 
stage of spiritual development and falls down from that satge. The mendicant who 
takes exhaustive steps he does not touch eleventh stage and reaches twelfth from 
tenth stage in a jumping way and becomes unfallible. Really the mendicant taking 
exhaustive step raises up one after another development stage, but not touching 
eleventh reaches twelfth directly. Then exhausting all ghati (soul-binding) karmas 
attains infinite knowledge and perception. Then crossing twelfth stage he stays 
himself in thirteenth stage of spiritual development and remains there till whole life 
but a little span of period. During this period he enters in fourteenth stage of spiritual 
development and within a few seconds becomes emancipated and reaching on the 
top of loka enjoys soul-bliss upto infinite time. 
In the present maxim scripturist giving the word apuvvakarana pointed out the 
relativeness of apurvakarana with monk Gaja Sukumala. Its inherent idea is this, that 
monk Gaja Sukumala entering the eighth stage of spiritual development had taken 
the exhaustive step. 
 […13] Meaning-  
Passing that night and at the dawn of second day Krushna Vasudeva bathed 
and adorned by clothes and ornaments rode on an elephant. He was wearing the 
garland of Koranta flowers and canopy was on his head, white and best camaras 
were fanned on his both sides. Surrounded by numerous strong warriors, moving on 
the royal road started from Dwaraka to go where Bhagavana Arishthanemi was. 
While going through middle part of Dwaraka Krushna Vasudeva saw a man, 
who was too old, with body bathered by old age, weak, wearied and tired. Out of his 
house, on the royal road a huge heap of bricks was accumulated. That oldman was 
carrying bricks from that heap one by one and keeping in the inner part of his house. 
Krushna Vasudeva seeing that grieved old man, filled with compassion. 
Sitting on elephant he took up one brick from that heap and put in the inner part of 
his house. 
When the numerous followers saw Shree Krushna Vasudeva putting a brick 
from that heap then all of them put one brick in the house of that old man. 
Consequently heap was finished. In this way only taking one brick by Shreekrsna, 
the turmoil of carrying brick of that old bathered bodied man came to an end. 
After that passing through the middle of Dwaraka city Krushna Vasudeva 
reached Sahasramravana, where Bhagavana Arishthanemi was present. He bowed 
down and worshipped Bhagavana.

After that passing through the middle of Dwaraka city Krushna Vasudeva 
reached Sahasramravana, where Bhagavana Arishthanemi was present. He bowed 
down and worshipped Bhagavana. 
After that he moved his eys to see his younger brother newly consecrated 
monk Gaja Sukumala to bow down to him; but could not find him there. Then he is 
bowing down to Bhagavana Ristanemi asked-Bhagawan! Where is my younger 
uterine brother the newly consecrated monk? I want to bow down to him. 
Then Arihanta Arishthanemi replying to the question of Krushna Vasudeva 
said- Krushna! The purpose for which Gaja Sukumala accepted consecration he has 
attained that. 
Hearing this worried Krushna Vasudeva asked Arihanta Arishthanemi-
Bhagawan! How Gaja Sukumala was attained his goal (salvation of soul)? 
Then Arhat Arishthanemi replied to Krushna Vasudeva-O Krushna! Verily 
Gaja Sukumala bowed down to me yesterday in the first part of afternoon and then 
said-O Lord! If you permit me I intend to accept and observe monk’s twelfth special 
resolution (Bhiksu-Mahapratima) of one night in Mahakala cemetery. Getting my 
permission Gaja Sukumala went to Mahakala cemetery, accepted the great 
resolution, stood up and went deep into meditation. 
Thereafter a man saw monk Gaja Sukumala and became red in fury. Thus 
telling full description Bhagavana said-O Krushna! Thus monk Gaja Sukumala 
obtained his goal-the salvation of his soul. 
Hearing all this Krushna began to inquire from Bhagavana Arishthanemi- O 
Reverend Sir! Who is that shameless person, desirous of undesirable-desirous of 
death, who has untimely made my younger uterine brother monk Gaja Sukumala 
lifeless? 
Then Arhat Arishthanemi spoke thus to Krushna Vasudeva- O Krushna! Do 
not be invidious towads that person, because really he became helpful to monk Gaja 
Sukumala for attaining his goal-purification of soul. 
Hearing this Shreekrsna Vasudeva was non-plussed again and asked-O 
Bhagawan! That person became helpful to monk Gaja Sukumala (attaining his end). 
How is it so? 
Then Arhat Arishthanemi clearly replied to Vasudeva Shreekrsna in this way-
Yes Krushna! Definitely he helped. 
When you were coming to bow down to me then you saw an old man carrying 
one brick from the heap of bricks which was accumulated before his house on the 
main road. You had picked up one brick and carrying that placed it in his house. 
Seeing you putting one brick all of your followers, picking up those bricks put 
down in the house of that old man. Thus by your this help the turmoil of putting down 
those bricks one by one inside his house finished. 
O Krushna! Just as you lent aid to finish that oldman’s turmoil, in the same 
way O Krushna! That person also aided Gaja Sukumala monk to completely 
annihilate the accumulated karmas of numerous previous births. 
Hearing this Shreekrsna Vasudeva asked Arhat Arishthanemi-O Bhagawwan! 
How can I recognize that person? 
Bhagavana Arishthanemi spoke thus unto Vasudeva Shreekrsna- O Krushna! 
Returning from here when you will enter Dwaraka city, at that time seeing you the 
person who will be frightened and standing there due to completion of life span will 
die. You should consider that definitely he is the person concemed.

Satisfied with reply of his question Krushna Vasudeva bowed down and did 
reverence to Arhat Arishthanemi, went to the place where his excellent elephant was 
standing, rode on it and started towards his royal palace. 
On the other side, as the sun shone with luster, such thoughts arose in the 
mind of Somila Brahmana- 
‘Today, Krushna Vasudeva must have definitely gone to bow down to Arhat 
Arishthanemi. He is omniscient. Nothing is hidden from him. He must have known all 
details about death of Gaja Sukumala and my ill-deed. Arihanta Arishthanemi must 
have told everything to Krushna Vasudeva. In these conditions, becoming agitated 
Krushna Vasudeva will kill me in a cruel manner that I do not know. Thinking thus he 
was frightened, came out of home and decided to run far away out of the city. 
He thought-Krushna will return via royal road. Therefore I should run away 
through any small street and get out of the city before he returns. Thinking thus, he 
came out his home and ran through a small street. 
Krushna Vasudeva was full of sorrow due to the cruel death of his younger 
brother monk Gaja Sukumala. So he was returning through the same street. 
As Krushna Vasudeva entered Dwaraka city, perchance, all of a sudden he 
(Somila) came in front of him. Then that Somila Brahmana seeing Krushna 
Vasudeva was frightened, stunned, remained standing as he was and ue to 
completion of life span the limbs of his body loosened and he (Somila) fell down on 
the ground with a great sound dhadama. He became lifeless. 
Krushna Vasudeva saw Somila falling down dead, so he spoke- 
O beloved of gods! This is the person desirous of death, shameless Somila 
Brahmana who has untimely killed my younger uterine brother monk Gaja Sukumala. 
Saying thus Krushna Vasudeva caused to be pulled and thrown the corpse of 
Somila by Candalas He then got washed the land touched by the dead body of 
Somila. And then he entered his palace.

became apathetic to the world. With permission of his parents, he accepted 
consecration, before Arihanta. Aristhanemi. He studied twelve angas (Holy 
Scriptures) and practiced sage-consecration upto sixteen years. Then like Gautama 
Kumara, he accepted Samlekhana and practiced Samthara for one month on mount 
Satrunjaya and exhausting all karmas beatified. 
Like Jali Kumara the descriptions of 2. Mayali Kumara, 3. Uvayali Kumara, 4. 
Purusasena Kumara and 5. Varisena Kumara should be known. All these were the 
sons of King Vasudeva and queen Dharini. 
In the same way the life-character of sixth Pradyumna Kumara should be 
known. Excepting; his father was Shree Krushna and mother was Rukmini. 
The same is the life description of seventh Samba Kumara. Excepting; his 
father was Shree Krushna and mother was Jambavati. 
Siilar is the life-description of Aniruddha Kumra in eighth chapter. Excepting; 
his father was Pradyumna Kumara and mother was Vaidarbhi. 
Similar is the description of Satyanemi in ninth chapter and Dradhanemi in 
tenth chapter. Excepting; father of these both Samudravijaya and mother was 
Sivadevi. As such, these both were the younger brothers of Bhagavana 
Arishthanemi. 
All these chapters are alike in description. This is the substance of fourth 
section. 
Shree Sudharma Swami said-Thus O Jambu! Shramana Bhagavana 
Mahavira has expressed the subject matter of fourth section containing ten chapters, 
which I have told you.

[20…] Meaning-  
Arya Jambu asked-O Bhagawan! If salvated Shramana Bhagavana Mahavira 
had narrated ten chapters of fifth section, then what subject matter did he describe in 
first chapter? 
 
 
[…20] Meaning-  
Sudharma Swami uttered- O Jambu! At that time and at that period, there was 
a city nmed Dwaraka. Its description has been given in the first chapter of first 
section, until that Shree Krushna Vasudeva ruled over it. 
Padmavati was his queen. She was very tender and beautiful. So he was 
describable. 
At that time and at that period. Arihana Arishthanemi enshrining his soul by 
penance and restraint came to Dwaraka. For bowing down and worshipping him 
Shree Krushna started from his royal palace and reaching near Bhagavana began to 
worship him. 
At that time when queen Padmavati heard the auspicious news of arrival of 
Bhagavana, she became very glad. She too, like queen Devaki, riding on religious 
chariot, went to bow down to Bhagavana. She worshiped Arhat Arishthanemi. 
Arihanta Arishthanemi preached religious sermon to Krushna Vasudeva, Padmavati 
Devi and entire congregation. He also told religious tales. Hearing religious sermon, 
tales and doctrines people went back to their home. 
Then bowing down to and worshipping Bhagavana Arishthanemi, Vasudeva 
Krushna asked him a question- 
O Bhagawan! How twelve yojana long and nine yljana wide this Dwaraka city 
that is like heaven, will be destroyed? 
Arihanta Arishthanemi thus replied unto Krushna Vasudeva-O Krushna! 
Definitely, twelve yojana long and nine yojana wide this Dwaraka city that is like 
heaven will be destroyed by wine, fire and anger of Dvaipayana risis (penance); i.e. 
these three would be the causes of Dwaraka’s destruction. 
Hearing the impending causes of Dwaraka city’s destruction from Arihanta 
Arishthanemi, such thoughts aroused in the mind of Krushna Vasudeva-“Blessed are 
Jali, Mayali, Uvayali, Purusasena, Varisena, Pradyumna, Samba, Aniruddha, 
Dradhnemi, Satyanemi and other princes, who giving up gold, silver, jewels etc. 
wealth and family members consecrated near Bhagavana Arishthanemi, with shaven 
heads. I am unblessed and without meritorious deeds, because I am deep drowned 
in kingdom, harem, and passionate pleasure of man. I am not capable to give up 
those pleasures and to accept consecration near Bhagavana Arishthanemi and so I 
can not enter the sage-order. 
Bhagavana Arishthanemi being aware of the mental thoughts of Krushna 
Vasudeva and knowing him deep in inauspicious feeling said thus to Krushna 
Vasudeva- 
Definitely O Krushna! Such thoughts aroused in your mind that blessed are 
Jali, Mayali and other princes, who entered sage order renouncing wealth, fortune 
and family members. I am unblessed, without meritorious deeds as I am deeply --

drowned in kingdom, harem, and passionate pleasures relating to man. I cannot 
accept consecration near Bhagwana. 
O Krushna! Is it not true? 
Shree Krushna replied-Yes Bhagawan! What you have told is a fact and true. 
Bhagavana said- Then O Krushna! It has never happened, nor is and never 
will be that any Vasudeva (ruler of three regions of India) in his present birth, giving 
up cattle and agriculture, gold, kingdom and wealth, may accept sagehood. 
Vasudeva never accepted consecration in past, cannot accept in present and will not 
accept in future. 
Shree Krushna asked-Bhagawan! Why and what for it is said that it never 
happened in past, nor can happen in present and never will happen in future? 
Then Arhat Arishthanemi replied to Shree Krushna Vasudeva in these words-
O Krushna! All the Vasudevas in their previous births have made a sinful strong 
violition. Therefore I say that it never happened in past, can not happen in present 
and never will happen in future that any Vasudeva may accept consecration giving 
up all his wealth etc. 
[…20]Commentary: - 
In Jain literature Shree Krushna is called Krushna Vasudeva. According to 
grammatical basis the meaning of word Vasudeva is-the son of Vasudeva 
(VAsudevasya apatyam puman Vasudevah). The name of Krushna’s father was 
Vasudeva. So he is called Vasudeva word Vasudeva generally denotes Krushna. 
Really it is Krushna’s other name. 
Though this meaning of word Vasudeva is generally in vogue, yet this word 
became technical in Jainology. Hence Vasudeva word is used for all monarchs or 
sovereigns of half the land (rulers of three regions of India). According to Jain 
tradition, there became nine Vasudevas in this Avasarpini Kala (time era). The 
names of this are-1. Triprstha, 2.Dwiprstha, 3.Swayambhu, 4.Purusottama, 
5.Purusasingha, 6.Puruspundarika, 7.Datta, 8.Narayana (Laxmana) and 9.Krushna. 
Among all these Krushna is the last Vasudeva. 
According to Jain tradition Vasudeva is an appellation. As such, this technical 
term indicates the person who has seven gems, the ruler of three regions out of sis 
regions (of India) and his many occult powers. According to Jain-view, Vasudeva, 
conquering and killing Prati-Vasudeva, rules over three regions as the only monarch. 
Besides this, among twenty eight high occult powers, Vasudeva speciality is 
also considered as special occult power. To obtain this dignity is the fruition of 
Vasudeva occult power. 
Vasudeva has enormous strength and power. Jainacaryas have described 
this strength and power by a simile-Sitting on the bank of a well and eating food 
there, the Vasudeva, if binded by iron chains if pulled by sixteen thousand rulers with 
their fourfold army using their full power cannot pull him; but if Vasudeva wishes he 
can pull all of them towards himself easily by his only left hand, with the medium of 
the same iron chain. 
The description of Shree Krushna that we find in Jain Holy Scripture (agamas) 
is opulent with the same Vasudeva occult power. 
Niyana Kada-Nidankrta-Nidana is a special technical word in Jain tradition. 
Due to the rise of infatuation relating karma when the sage, nun, laymen or lay 
women make a sinful strong volition in heart that as the fruition of the austerity I must 
obtain such and such thing, it is called sinful resolution (Nidana). Generally people

term it in folk language as niyana. Volition never brings bliss. 
The person, who dies making a sinful resolugion, even after getting the fruit 
according to that resolution, he cannot attain salvation. The appellation of Vasudeva 
is the fruit of sinful strong volition made in previous birth. Hence, in the life span of 
Vasudeva no person can enter monk-order, giving up worldly pleasures. 
For detailed study of sinful strong volition (nidana) readers are suggested to 
see the book Antakrddasa Mahima.

The Krushna Vasudeva spoke thus to Arihanta Arishthanemi-O Bhagawan! 
Leaving the body at the time of death, where shall I go? Where shall I take birth? 
Arihanta Arishthanemi said thus to Krushna Vasudeva-O Krushna! Dwaraka 
city will be burnt and destroyed due to the causes-wine, fire and wrath of 
Dwaipayana and at the loss of your parents and family members you will also be 
bereaved. Then you with Rama-Baladeva will start along southern coast of sea 
towards the city of Pandumathura, to go to Yudhisthira (elder) (Bhima, Arjuna, 
Nakula, and Sahadeva). The five sons of king Pandu-five Pandavas. In between you 
will reach Kosambi forest. For taking rest you will sleep under a huge banyan tree, 
and on a stone-rock covering your body with a yellow robe. At that time, you will be 
pierced in the left food by a sharp arrow released from the bow (in the delusion of a 
deer) of Jara Kumara. Thus you will leave this body.

Description of Dwaraka-Destruction and Body-releasement by Krushna. 
According to prevailing narrative, it is said that knowing wine as the cause of 
Dwaraka-destruction Shree Krushna announced wine-prohibition in whole Dwaraka 
city and remaining quantity of wine was ordered to he thrown away out of the city. So 
the wine had been thrown away in hills surrounding Dwaraka city. That wine 
accumulated in ditches of mountain. 
Once some princes riding on horses went out of the city for a walk. Being 
thirsty princes drank up that wine. Nearby Dwaipayana Rishi was sitting in deep 
meditation. Yadava princes became fanatic due to intoxication of wine. As they saw 
(penance) Dwaipayana, they filled with anger bearing in mind that this penance will 
destroy our beautiful city so he should be murdered just now.  
They caused their horses to jump over penance. Corpse of a snake was lying 
down there, the princes put it round the neck of penance and began to beat him 
cruelly and when penance became half-dead, those princes returned to the city, 
thinking that now the penance will die. 
Due to cruel beating and even without any causes the anger of Dwaipayana 
penance raised to highest degree. He made a firm sinful volition-If there is any 
consequence of my penance, then I must kill all the Yadavas and burn this Dwaraka 
city to ashes. 
As soon as, Krushna became aware of this painful event, he quickly reached 
to penance, with his elder brother Balarama, Krushna begged pardon for the offence 
of princes and requested that he should withdraw his volition. Being satisfied by the 
courtesy of Shree Krushna, penance Dwaipayana assured him that you and your 
elder brother-both will go safely out of city; but I (Dwaipayana) will not withdraw my 
volition. Thus saying penance Dwaipayana died and took birth in the class of fiery 
gods (Agnikumara god). Both the brothers, being disappointed returned from there.

Shree Krushna asked a wise sage, the device to save Dwaraka then the sage 
said-Until Ayambila penance will be regularly practiced in Dwaraka city by its 
inhabitants, no god or demon can destroy it. 
Accordingly Shree Krushna made an announcement in the city that Ayambila 
penance should continue. Citizens followed the announcement of ruler. 
Dwaipayana penance becoming fiery god, remembering his previous birth’s 
enmity came to Dwaraka to burn it, but he cannot fulfil his evil desire due to the 
mighty force of Ayambila penance. 
Although Dwaipayana fiery god could not burn Dwaraka at that time but he did 
not stop his efforts. He continually waited for twelve years to avail any opportunity to 
fulfil his desire. 
Time of twelve years was very long. Citizens of Dwaraka began to think 
otherwise-A long period of twelve years has been passed practicing Ayambila 
penance continually. Now how that fiery god Dwaipayana can hazard us? He must 
have been disappointed and gone elsewhere. 
Thinking of some other citizens was like this-All the other citizens are 
practicing Ayambila penance. If we persons do not practice the penance what 
different will it make? 
Lo, such a day arrived that all the citizens of Dwaraka became disinclined to 
obstacle remover Ayambila penance. 
This was the best opportunity for fiery god Dwaipayana. He availed this fully. 
Fire began to pour from sky, frightful voices echoed all directions, stormy 
winds blew up, houses began to fall due to earth quake, very soon the tremendous 
flames of fire galloped the wholly city Dwaraka. 
Vasudeva Krushna did many efforts to extinguish fire; but the agitation of 
karmas was so forceful and hazardous that water thrown on fire was proving as oil. 
Though water quenches fire, but at that time as much as water was poured the fire 
went on increasing. It seemed that high raising flames of fire trying to burn the sky. 
Krushna Vasudeva and Balarama-both brothers were disappointed. Dwaraka burnt 
to ashes before their eyes, but they could not save it. 
After burning Dwaraka to ashes Krushna and Balarama made preparations to 
go from there. This has been elaborated by theses words (Sura Diwayana kova 
nidaddhaye) 
‘Amma – piya – niyaga – Vipahune’-(Ambapitra-Nijaka-Viprahinah)-meaning 
bereaved from mother-father and relatives. Folklorists assert-When Dwaraka city 
was burning, then Krushna Vasudeva and his elder brother Balarama-both were 
trying to stop fire, but they could not succeed in their efforts, then they reached to 
their palace and began to save their parents. With great difficulty they could take out 
their parents from palace. Their idea was that riding on a chariot the parents may be 
taken to a safe place. For fulfilling this purpose Shree Krushna reached his stable 
(aswasala). There he saw stable has been burnt up. Sooner he started from there 
and reached chariot-shelter.  
It was also burning; but one chariot was safe. Quickly he took out that chariot. 
Making parents sit in it both brothers began to draw it like horses. As soon as they 
were to cross the main gate, the upper part of the gate fell down. Parents died under 
it. Both brothers could not see such a painful scene. They became very much 
restless due to bereavement of parents. Anyhow they held up themselves and 
tolerated the great distress caused by the death of parents and relations.

Shree Krushna was too much worried by burning Dwaraka city. He said to 
Balarama-Patron (shelter-giver) of others, whose shelter shall we take today? 
Balarama suggested-You have always helped Pandavas. It would be proper 
to go there. 
At that time Pandavas, exiled from Hastinapura, were residing at 
Pandumathura. 
The episode of Pandavas’ exilement from Hastinapura should be known from 
Jnatadharmakatha Sutra. 
Hearing the suggestion of Balarama, Shree Krushna spoke thus unto him-It is 
shameful to seek shelter from those, to whom I have given shelter, Subhadra (wife of 
Arjuna) is our sister. To live in sister’s house is not praiseworthy. 
Hearing the proper clue of Shree Krushna, Balaram said-Dear brother! Kunti 
is our father’s sister (aunt-Bhuva-Phuphi). There is nothing disgraceful to go and live 
in aunt’s home. 
Though Shree Krushna was unwilling but Balarama proceeded towards the 
capital city of Pandavas, Pandumathura, which was situated at the deccan coast of 
the sea, taking Shree Krushna with him. 
The scripturist has given the words-‘dahinaveyalie abhimuhe pndumathuram 
sampatthiye. These words are indicating towards this very episode. 
The word Jarakumarenam means Jara Kumara himself or by Jarakumara. 
Jarakumaras was a prince in Yadava tradition or lineage, who was brother of Shree 
Krushna. Bhagavana Arishthanemi told in his forecast that the death of Shree 
Krushna will happen by the arrow of Jarakumara. Knowing this Jarakumara grieved 
much. He decided-I will go to Kosamravana (forest) leaving Dwaraka and there I will 
reside till death and thus I will not be the cause of death of Shree Krushna. 
According to his decision Jarakumara began to live in Kosamra forest. But 
who can challenge the destined destiny? 
After burning Dwaraka, Shree Krushna was going to Pandumathura. ON the 
way there was Kosamba forest. Krushna felt eager in thirst. Balarama went to bring 
water. Krushna began to take rest under a huge banyan tree lying down on a slab of 
stone and covering his body by a yello robe. He had put his leg on the other leg. 
Every Vasudeva has padma-mani in his foot. From a distance as eye of deer shines 
such was the shining of the padma-mani in the foot of Shree Krushna. Jarakumara 
was wandering in the same forest. He was in the search of prey. When he came 
near that huge banyan tree, then from a distance, it seemed to him that a deer is 
sitting under the tree. At once he put a sharp arrow on the bow and released it with 
his full strength. As the arrow pierced the foot of Shree Krushna he tossed and 
trembled about. A painful cry came out of his mouth. He thought lest this arrow may 
be of Jarakumara. Hearing that painful human cry Jarakumara also came there 
almost running and began to weep bitterly. Seeing Jarakumara in front, Shree Krsina 
said to him- 
Jarakumara! What is your fault in it? It was such destined. How could be 
otherwise the forecast of Bhagavana Arishthanemi? Balarama is about to reach 
here. You quickly run away from here, otherwise you cannot remain alive, Balarama 
will definitely kill you. 
Jarakumara wanted to escape from the meanest deed and for this he left 
Dwaraka and accepted to live in Kosamra forest, but the same sin occurred by his 
own hands. He began to weel bitterly. But what can be done now? What has been -

 done cannot be undone. 
Shree Krushna had died, before Balarama returned. 
[…20] Meaning-  
Then Krushna Vasudeva having heard and listened to this whole matter from 
ARhat Arishthanemi, with his all hopes laid low, drowened deep in passive-thoughts. 
Then Arhat Arishthanemi said-O beloved of gods!Do not brood with all hopes 
laid low. Definitely O beloved as gods !after a definite period of time in this 
Bharatksetra, of Jambudvipa in forthcoming Utsarpini time era, in Satadwara city of 
Pundra area you would be twelfth tirthamkara, named Amama. There you will 
wander as omniscient (kevalin) and then will attain salvation. 
Having heard and listened to this description of his own most brilliant future 
Krushna Vasudeva became very much glad. In the emotion of happiness he clapped 
his arms, moved three step backwards and roared like a lion and then bowing down 
and praising-worshipping Arhat Arishthanemi rode on his own excellent elephant 
worthy for royal emblem and moving through the middle of Dwaraka came to his own 
palace. 
Then he got down from his excellent elephant, went to the outer audience 
chamber, came to and sat on his throne with face in eastern direction and then 
calling his chamberlains and state-servants spoke thus- 
O beloved of gods! You go and declare my proclamation at the open places, 
fourway, three way crossing etc; of Dwaraka city, that- 
O the citizens of Dwaraka! This twelve yojana long and nine yojana broad, 
heaven like Dwaraka city will be destroyed any day due to wine, fire and 
Dwaipayana penance. Therefore, O beloved of gods!if any person whether he may 
be a king, heir apparent, minister or lord (Iswara), dear to king or like a king 
(talawara) baron (lord of a small village), head of two or three families (Kotumbika), 
banker-too much wealthy person, queen prince, maiden, princess, queen of a king, 
daughter of a king intends to enter the sage order of Bhagavana Arishthanemi after 
being shaven-headed and consecrated, Shree Krushna gladly allows such persons 
to do so. Shree Krushna Vasudeva will himself celebrate his consecration with great 
splendor in a gathering. Shree Krushna Vasudeva also holds responsibility of the 
family members of the consecrated persons dependent on them. He will provide all 
necessities and comforts to those family members. 
O beloved as gods (chamberlains)! Proclaim this proclamation twice and 
thrice at all the places and report to me. 
Hearing the order of Krushna Vasudeva the chamberlains twice and thrice 
proclaimed this proclamation and reported to him. 
Thereafter, queen Padmavati became much more glad and satisfied and took 
to her heart the sermon of Bhagavana Arishthanemi. Her heart filled with happiness, 
Bowng down and worshipping Arihanta Arishthanemi, she spoke thus- 
O Bhagawan! I have faith in the Nirgrantha Pravacana (doctrine). The fact is 
as you have said. Your sermon is true to the last. I inend to accept consecration with 
my shaven head in presence of you, with the permission of Krushna Vasudeva. 
Bhagavana said- O beloved of gods! Do, as your mind feels. But do not delay 
in religious deed.  
After that riding on an excellent religious chariot Padmavati Devi came in 
Dwaraka city and to her palace. Riding off from Chariot she came before Shree 
Krushna Vasudeva and folding her both hands spoke thus unto him --

O beloved of gods! Having heard and listened to the sermon (religious 
discourse) of Arhat Arishthanemi my mind became disinclined from world and 
worldly pleasures. Hence, if you permit me, I intend to tonsure my head and accept 
consecration in presence of Arhat Arishthanemi. 
Krushna said- Do, as you feel happy. 
Then Vasudeva Krushna called his chamberlains and ordered them- 
O beloved of gods! Quickly make the enormous preparations of consecration 
ceremony of queen Padmavati and report to me. 
Chamberlains obeyed the order of Vasudeva, made preparations according to 
his wishes and reported him. 
        […20] Meaning-  
Then Krushna VAsudeva got seated padmavati Devi on a special seat and 
she was bathed with water from one hundred eight pitchers of gold and conronated 
for consecration. Then, she was decorated with all kinds of ornaments, and was 
seated in the palanquin, which was carried by one thousand men, moving through 
the central part of Dwaraka city. They reached Sahasramaravana, which was 
situated on mount Raivataka. There Padmavati Devi got down from the palanquin. 
Keeping queen Padmavati ahead of him, Shree Krushna came to Bhagavana 
Arishthanemi circumambulated him three times, bowed down and worshipped, then 
said thus- 
O Bhagawan! This Padmavati Devi is my chief queen. She is pleasing, 
charming, beloved, beautiful and enchanting to me. She is dear to me like life force, 
and is pleasing to my heart. This excellent woman is like a flower of wild fig tree 
(gulara) which is such a rare  object that it is very difficult to hear about, not to speak 
of seeing. O beloved of gods!I offer unto you my such beloved wife, as a gift of 
woman disciple. Please, accept it. 
Having heard the request of Krushna Vasudeva spoke thus Bhagavana 
Arishthanemi-O beloved of gods!Do, as you feel happy. 
Then Padmavati Devi went to North-East direction, removed with her own 
hands her ornaments and also with her own hands tonsured her hairs in five 
attempts, then came to Bhagavana Arishthanemi, bowing down and worshipping him 
she spoke- 
O Bhagawan! This world is burning in the fire of birth, death, oldage etc. 
Hence for liberation from the fire of all these miseries and for saving my soul from     
burning world, I intend to accept consecration. Therefore kindly take me into monk

A gardener or garland maker, named Arjuna was the resident of that city. He 
was rich and unsurpassable. The name of his wife was Bandhumati. She was tender 
and much beautiful. 
That Arjuna garland-marker had a big flower-garden outside the city 
Rajagraha. That garden was covered by dense blue leaves. So it seemed as the 
dense clouds in the sky. Flowers of five colours bloomed in it. So that garden was 
heart-pleasing eye-capturing and worth seeing.

Near that garden was a sanctuary of deity (god) Yaksa Mudgarapani. That 
deity had devolved upon him from a line of many ancestors of the family from father, 
grand father etc. Ancient, divine and true influensive, like the sanctuary of 
Purnabhadra deity. 
In that sanctuary there was an idol of deity (Yaksa) Mudgarapani having held 
the iron mace weighing once thousand palas (according to modern weight about 57 
Kilogram heavy) in his hand. 
Arjuna garland-maker from his childhood was fervent devotee of that deity. 
Every morning, he took bamboo basket, went out of the city Rajagrha, arrived at his 
flower-garden, plucked and made collection of flowers. 
Then he took the foremost and best flowers approached the sanctuary of deity 
Mudgarapani, devotedly worshipped him, made the flower-offering of best quality, 
bowed falling over his knees and afterwards would go on highway and sitting there 
on a side, he would sell his flowers. Thus he was passing his life happily. 
Here in Rajagraha city dwelt a bunch of friends, named Lalita, which was very 
rich and unsurpassed, i.e., none can defeat that gang. That gang also possessed the 
royal mandate that ‘what ever the members of this gang do are quiet correct.’ 
(Perhaps this gang had done some good to the ruler of the city. Pleased he 
had passed such mandate that ‘these gangsters are free to do as they like.’ They 
had the patronage of the ruler. So this gang (members of gang) became quite free, 
mischievous and wicked.) 
One day, in the city an announcement was made to celebrate a pleasure 
festival-ceremony. Then that garland-maker-gardener Arjuna thought that tomorrow 
the demand of flowers would be very much. Having this idea he awoke early in the 
morning that day and taking his bamboo-baskets, went out from house early with his 
wife Bandhumati, moving through the city reached his flower-garden. There, with his 
wife, he began to collect flowers, plucking from plants. 
At that time the six members of Lalita gang came to the shrine (sanctuary) of 
Mugdarapani deity and began to enjoy rejoicings and merriments. 
On other side, garland-maker Arjuna gathered flowers, taking best flowers 
moved towards the shrine with his wife Bandhumati. 
Six gangsters saw Arjuna coming to the shrine with his wife Bandhumati. 
Seeing them, gangsters discussed with one-another and decided-Friends 
!thisgarland-maker Arjuna is coming here with his wife Bandhumati. It is a good 
opportunity for us; we must bind Arjuna fast-by twisting the arms and head and tying 
them to the back, fell him and then enjoy sexual pleasures according to our desire 
with his beautiful and tender wife Bandhumati. 
Thus deciding, all the six gangsters hid behind the doors of shrine, stood 
hidden and waited silently for them to come. 
Arjuna garland-maker entered the shrine of Mudgarapani deity with his wife 
Bandhumati, revered and bowed down on seeing it, made flower-offerings and 
bowed down falling upon his knees. 
In the meanwhile seeing best opportunity, all of a sudden, those six fellows 
came out from behind the doors, caught Arjuna garland-maker, bound him fast and 
made him fall aside. Then began to enjoy sexual pleasures to the fullest and by 
various postures and methods with Bandhumati, the wife of Arjuna garland-maker. 
Seeing such a mean misdeed (license) before his own eyes, such thoughts 
aroused in the mind of garland-maker Arjuna-Thus indeed, from my childhood, I go

on revering Mudgarapani deity, considering as my favourite god. After its reverence, 
I carry on my business. Had there been deity Mudgarapani really present, would he 
remain silent seeing me in such a tyranny? Therefore deity Mudgarapani is not 
present here. It is only a puppet of wood. 
Knowing such types of mental thoughts of Arjuna garland-maker deity 
Mudgarapani entered in his body and shattered off his bonds. 
Then Arjuna garland-maker, possessed by deity Mudgarapani took hold of 
that iron mace weighing one thousand palas (about 57 kilogram heavy) holding in his 
hand moved round and killed those six gangsters, along with his wife Bandhumati, 
by its strokes. 
Thus killing those seven persons, that Arjuna garland-maker possessed by 
deity Mudgarapani, began to move round about external boundary of Rajagraha city 
killing six men and one women everyday.. 
 […27] Meaning-  
At that time, at the triangular paths, highways and all other open places of 
Rajagraha city many people used to say to one another-O beloved as gods !garland- 
Maker Arjuna, being possessed by deity Mudgarapani, is murdering six men and one 
women-thus seven persons daily, moving outside the city Rajagrha. 
When king Srenika came to know about this, then he called his chamberlains 
and ordered them- 
O beloved of gods! Arjuna garland-maker, wandering outside Rajagraha city 
is murdering 7 persons-six men and one woman everyday. Therefore you announce 
my order by these words-which no one should go out of city for taking grass, wood, 
fuel, water and flowers, fruits etc. If any body goes out of the city, it is possible that 
his body may be destroyed i.e. he may be murdered. 
O beloved of gods! Thus announce this declaration twice and thrice in whole 
city and report to me soon. 
Then those chamberlains announced the royal mandate twice and thrice 
wandering in the whole city and reported to king that his order had been carried out. 
In that city Rajagraha lived a richman named Sudarsana. He was too much 
wealthy and could not be surpassed by any one. He was worshipper of sages and 
well-versed in elements like soul and non-soul etc., giver of pure food-water etc., to 
monks. 
At that time and at that period Bhagavana Mahavira, wandering village to 
village, arrived in city Rajagrha and stayed in the garden situated outside of the city. 
Having heard of the information about arrival of Bhagavana, the numerous 
citizens of Rajagrha city gathering at triangular ways and highways said thus to one 
another-(O beloveds as gods) Shramana Bhagavana Mahavira has arrived here. By 
hearing his name only one gets the fruits of great merit, then by seeing him, hearing 
his discouse and accepting the doctrines preached by him the fruit one gets, what to 
say about that? (That cannot be described). 
[27] Commentary: - 
In the introduction of Sudarsana words are given in original text abhigaye 
jivajive java viharai. By these words should be understood the life and conduct of 
course-holders as described in Bhagawati Sutra (2/5). The special religious faculties 
are to be considered deeply. These are as follows and Sudarsana Sresthi was 
opulent with all these qualities.

He was worshipper of sages and religious, virtuous house-holder. Beside the 
knower of soul and non-soul he was also well versed in conception of merits and 
demerits. In the same way, he was conversant about influex of karmas, checking of 
karmas, shedding off karmas, activities (causes of bondage of karmas-twentyfive 
types of activities), supports (means of karma-bondage) (and the concept of 
bondage of karmas and salvation. He did not seek assistance of any other in any 
work. He was so firmly steady in Jain doctrines (Nirgrantha pravacana-preachings of 
tirthankaras) that even gods, semigods, deities, demons etc., could not distract him. 
He had neither doubt nor desire and no suspense about the fruits of religion and 
religious activities. He has graspec the ultimate meaning of Holy Scriptures.  
He had retained the secret meanings of scriptures in a definite way. He had 
specially decided the suspicious points of scriptures. Enquiring from wise persons.  
His veins and bones were engrossed with the religious affection of omniscient’s 
preachings. He had unbreakable love toward preachings of tirthankara. He had such 
faith that the preachings of Arihanta are true, ultimate truth; out-topping and all 
others are without base (untrue). On account of his generosity the door-bolt of his 
house remained always high meaning his door always remained open for all.       
     
Whenever he entered any body’s house and even in his seraglio, he 
generated love and trust in him. He observed householder’s five small vows, virtuous 
vows and disinclination to attachment, refutation (pratyakhyana), pausadha, fast 
penance etc., and full pausadha on the eighth fourteenth, and fifteenth days of the 
lunar month. He earned advantage by giving faultless food, water, eatables, tasty 
things, cloths, utensils, blanket, duster (rajoharana), pitha, phalaka, bed, 
samstaraka, medicine etc., to sages. He used to purify his soul by practicing the 
accepted penances etc. 
Life of Sudarsan was opulent with these ideal virtues of a religious 
householder. 
[…27] Meaning-  
Thus having heard the news of arrival of Bhagavana outside Rajagraha city, 
from many persons, such thoughts aroused in the mind of Sudarsana Sresthi. 
Definitely, Shramana Bhagavana Mahavira has come to Rajagraha and is 
staying in Gunasilaka garden, which is situated out of city. Therefore I should go and 
bow down and worship him. 
Thinking such, Sudarsana came to his parents and with folded hands spoke 
thus unto them-O parents! Bhagavana Mahavira has been staying in garden, outside 
of city. Hence I intend to go in his service and should bow down and worship him. 
Hearing this, parents said to Sudarsana-O beloved son !out of the city Arjuna 
garland-maker murdering seven persons-six men and one women everyday, is 
wandering. So our beloved son! You must not go out of city for bowing down and 
worshipping Shramana Bhagavana Mahavira. If you go out of city, it is possible that 
your body may be injured. Therefore it is better that you bow down and worship 
Bhagavana from here. 
Then Sudarsana said to his parents-When Shramana Bhagavana Mahavira 
has come here and staying in the garden outside of city, then how it is possible that I 
bow down and worship him from here? So, O parents! Please allow me that I go 
there and bow down, worship and serve him. 
When parents could not prevail upon and could not stop Sudarsana, by many 
devices and declarations then unwillingly they said- O son! Do, as you feel happy.

Thus getting permission of parents, Sudarsana Sresthi bathed and put on 
clean clothes fit for religious assembly. Then he went out from his house. Walking 
on-foot he went out of Rajagraha city. Passing not too far nor too near from 
sanctuary of Mudgarapani deity he began to go to Gunasilaka garden, where 
Shramana Bhagavana Mahavira was staying.Visualising Sudarsana Sresthi passing 
nearby his sanctuary that Mudgarapani deity (garland-maker Arjuna possessed by 
deity) became very much angry. Brandishing his iron mace weighing one thousand 
palas (57 kilogram), he walked forward towards him. 
Acceptance of Sagari Pratima by Sudarsana 
As Sudarsana householder saw that angry Mudgarapani deity coming to him, 
he stopped at the place, he was. Though death was in front of him but he felt no fear 
neither sorrow. His heart was not frightened a bit but remained unafraid, unterrified, 
unalarmed, undisturbed, unmoved and unperturbed. He fearlessly cleansed the 
ground by the flap of his garment and sat down facing east eirection, made his left 
knee upward folding both the hands put on his forehead, After that spoke thus- 
Homage to Arihanta Bhagavana and all emancipated. Homage to Shramana 
and all to be emancipated in future Lord Mahavira. 
Even before, in presence of Shramana Bhagavana Mahavira I have accepted 
the vows of gross non-violence, truth, non-stealing, and satisfaction in my own wife 
and limiting the desire of possessions-for my whole life. Now even, considering the 
presence of the same Bhagavana Mahavira, I accept the full (great) vows of non-
violence, truth, non-stealing, celibacy and non-possession. I also completely 
renounce anger, pride, deceit, greed, until false belief-eighteen types of sins for 
whole life. I also renounce all the four kinds of meals-food, water, eatable and 
nutrients (dainties)-for whole life. 
If I be delivered from this calamity, it behoves me to follow it up; if I be not 
delivered from this calamity, I have already renounced all these. 
Decided such, Sudarsana Sresthi, accepted Sagari Padima, fast penance in 
aforesaid manner. 
 […27] Meaning-  
That Mudgarapani deity came to the sage-worshipper Sudarsana brandishing 
his iron mace weighing one thousand palas. But he could not overpower him, 
meaning could not hurt him. 
Mudgarapani deity moved oft and on around about Sudarsana sage-
worshipper and when could not overpower him by his strength, could not even raise 
his mace upon him, then he stood in front of Sudarsana sage-worshipper and began 
to gaze him with unwinking eyes for a long time. 
Thereafter overpowered by the spiritual strength of Sudarsana, that 
Mudgarapani deity, left the body of Arjuna garland-maker and taking his iron mace 
weighing one thousand palas returned to the direction from which he had come. 
Abandoned by Mudgarapani deity the garland-maker Arjuna fell on the ground 
with the sound of ‘dhus’ with all his limbs. 
Then Sudarsana sage-worshipper, finding himself free from calamity, 
completed his resolve of Sagari renouncements and refutals. He acompleted his 
meditation. 
Then that Arjuna garland-maker, on coming back to senses after awhile got 
up and seeing Sudarsana in front he spoke thus to him-O beloved as gods ! Who are 
you and where are you going?

Heraing these words Sudarsana spoke, thus to Arjuna garland-maker-O 
beloved of gods!I am knower of nine elements, Sudarsana sage-worshipper. I am 
going to garden Gunsilaka, to offer my respects to Shramana Bhagavana Mahavira. 
[…27] Meaning-  
Hearing this Arjuna garland-maker said to Sudarsana sage-worshipper-O 
beloved of gods!I too want to accompany you and bow down and worship Shramana 
Bhagavana Mahavira. 
Sudarsana ccorded-Do as you feel happy. But do not delay. 
Thereafter Arjuna with Sudarsana reached Gunasilaka garden. There he 
thrice bowed down and worshipped Shramana Bhagavana Mahavira. 
The Bhagavana Mahavira bestowed sermon to Arjuna, Sudarsana and huge 
public congregation. Listening sermon, Sudarsana returned to his home. 
Then Arjuna garland-maker, hearing and taking to heart the sermon of 
Shramana Bhagavana Mahavira became very much glad and satisfied, and politely 
said to Bhagavana-O Bhagawan ! I have faith, interest and belief in Nirgrantha 
Pravacana-the doctrines as preached by you. I intend to accept consecration at your 
lotus feet so that I can be free from the sins done by me. 
Prabhu said- Do, as you ffeel happy. Do not delay. 
Then Arjuna garland-maker went to north-east direction, tonsured his hairs by 
his own five fists and became homeless mendicant. Now garland-maker Arjuna 
became Arjuna monk. He began to practice restrain and austerity. 
Thereafter the day on which Arjuna monk accepted consecration with shaven 
head, he went to Shramana Bhagavana Mahavira, bowed down and worshipped him 
and then accepted firm resolution of the sort-I will practice two days’ fast penance 
(and third day to take meal) constantly till life. 
Accepting such firm resolution Arjuna monk began to wander in Rajagrha city. 
 […27] Meaning-  
Thereafter ARjuna monk on the fast breaking day in the first prahara studied 
scriptures, in the second did meditation and in the third prahara sallied forth for 
seeking meals from Rajagrha city. (His conduct should be considered similar to that 
of Gautama Swami) 
At that time seeing Arjuna mendicant wandering for seeking meals in the high-
low and middle class families, many citizens-men-women, boys-oldmen used to say- 
He has murdred my father, my mother, my brother, my sister, my wife, my 
son, my daughter, my daughter-in-law and other kith and kin etc. 
Saying thus some abused him, some caviled at him, chided, censured, 
rebuked, reviled, look down upto him in contempt, some struck him by hand, brick 
stone and stick etc. 
Even after getting abuse, chide, rebuke, revile, contempt, struck etc., from 
many men, women, children, youths, aged persons, youngsters, Arjuna mendicant 
did not become wrathful towards them even in though and bore all the calamities 
given by them with even mind. Although he was in a position to take revenge be 
adopted forgiveness, bore those troules gladly and understanding the benefit of 
shedding off karmas felt happiness, he bore all those hardships engrossed with right 
knowledge, pardoned them and considering all those troubles as good for soul-uplift,  
Wandered in high-low-circumstances, smiling he got food, but did not get water and 
sometimes he got water but did not get food.

In this position whatever a little but faultless he got, he accepted without 
becoming sorrowful, dispirited turbid, perturned, grieved, and remained in self-
discipline, i.e., he was never filled with dispiritedness making mind fifthy, he was 
always avoiding inauspicious thoughts, was never becoming sorrowful, and 
remained contemplated by all the three activities (Yoga) of mind, speech and body, 
Arjna mendicant practiced seeking of alms for penance. 
Thus he wandered for seeking alms. Wandering he came out of city, reached 
Gunsilaka garden and ame to Shramana Bhagavana Mahavira. Like Gautama 
Swami, he showed that food and water to Bhagavana and then getting his 
permission took meals without the feeling of myness, like-dislike and attachment, like 
a serpent entering in the hole. 
Then Shramana Bhagavana Mahavira went out of Gunasilaka garden and 
began to wander in other areas. 
Then that extremely fateful Arjuna mendicant completed his six months’ 
period of sagehood exercising himself the noble abundant zealous, specially 
beneficial penances fully well; and then adopted a fast penance of half-month i.e., a 
fortnight, avoided thirty meals, accepted samlekhana and consecration i.e., became 
beatified and salvated. 
[…27] Commentary: - 
It is mentioned in Srenika caritra etc. (religious compositions) that the body of 
Arjuna garland-maker was possessed by deity Mudgarapani upto six months in this 
period he murded 1260 persons. Because he used to kill 7 persons. 
Here one doubt arises that the person who had done such huge violence and 
degraded his soul to the lowest degree by this sinful deed, how could that means 
attain salvation by only six months’ propiliation? This doubt can be rectified thus-that 
penance had unimaginable, unarguable and wonderful strength. As Agama asserts-
The ill-deeds (karmas) accumulated even in millions of births can be exhausted by 
penance. 
When the fire of most excessive penance burns then the army of karmas is 
reduced o ashes like dry grass and straw. 
Besides this, it can also be said in this context that the murder done by Arjuna 
garland-maer, was really done by the deity. Therefore, the extremity of passions, 
responsible for killing persons, was not possible in Arjuna garland-maker. The heart 
of Arjuna garland-maker was simple and less-affected, but due to the possession of 
deity (Yaksa) hereturned to a murderer or assassin.

 [39] Meaning-  
Shree Jambu Swami asked in polite words-O Bhagawan! I have heard the 
subject matter of fourteen chapters. In fifteenth chapter was Bhagavana had 
described, please tell me. 
Arya Sudharma Swami began to narrate-O Jambu! At that time at and at that 
period, there was a city named Polaspura. There was a garden, named Shreevana. 
King Vijaya ruled there. His queen was Shreedevi. She was describable Atimukta 
was their son, who was tender, beautiful and worthy to be seen. 
At that time and at that period Shramana Bhagavana Mahavira wandering 
village to village arrived there and stayed in Shreevana garden. 
At that time and at that period, the eldest disciple of Shramana Bhagavana 
Mahavira. Indrabhuti (as described in Bhagavati Sutra, on the day of breking of two 
days’ fast he used to go for seeking alms with the permission of Bhagavana, such 
should be known here) began to wander in high-low-middle class houses of 
Polasapura city for seeking alms. 
At same time prince Atimuktakumara after taking bath until anointing his body, 
surrounded by many little boys, girls, lads, lasses, youths-maidens came out of his 
house, reached Indrasthana-play ground and began to play various types of games. 
At that time Reverend Gautama seeking alms from high-low-iddle class 
families of Polasapura city was passing near that play-ground. Then watching him, 
passing nearby Atmuktakumara quickly came to Gautama Swami and said-O 
reverend sir! Who are you and why are you wandering like this? 
Then Reverend Gautama replied to Atimuktakumara in this sweet words- O 
beloved of gods! We are sages, non-attached monks, heedful in walking and fully 
celebate. I am wandering in high-low-middle class families for alms

Hearing this Atimuktakumara spoke to Reverend Gautama thus-O reverend 
!you please come with me so that I may get you alms. 
So saying he held Reverend Gautama by finger and took him to his own 
house. 
As soon as queen Shreedevi saw Reverend Gautma coming to her house, 
she became very glad, got up from her seat, came to the Reverend Gautama 
circumambulated him thrice, bowed down and worshipped him and then gave him 
best meals-food, water, eatables and dainities in plenty and respectfully saw him off. 
Thereafter prince Atimuktakumara asked Reverend Gautama-O beloved of 
gods! Where do you live? 
Reverend Gautama answered-O beloved of gods!My religious preceptor and 
religious preacher Bhagavana Mahavira, promoter (beginner) of religion and 
desirous of attaining salvation, is staying abiding himself with restrain and austerity. 
He is staying here in Shreevana garden, outside the city of Polasapura, after taking 
proper permission, we all stay there. 
Then Atimuktakumara said to Reverend Gautama-Reverend Sir! Can I come 
with you to bow down to Bhagavana Mahavira? 
Gautama Swami said-O beloved of gods! Do as it pleases you. 
Then Atimuktakumara came to Bhagavana Mahavira with Gautama Swami, 
and thrice circumabulating Bhagavana bowed down and worshipped and sat near 
the Loard. 
Now Gautama came to Bhagavana Mahavira, showed him the meals he had 
brought and then took it. He later absorbed his soul in penance and constraint. 
In the mean time Shramana Bhagavana Mahavira told religious discourse to 
Atimuktakumara. Hearing and taking to heart theat discourse he became very glad 
and uttered- 
O beloved of gods! Your discourse is very interesting and dear to me. It 
touched my heart. Taking permission of my parents I intend to enter the sage order 
accepting consecration at your feet. 
Bhagavana said-Do, as you feel happy, O beloved as gods! But do not delay 
in auspicious deed. 
Thereafter, Atimuktakumara came to his parents, bowed down and said-I 
have heard the religious discours from Bhagavana. It was very interesting to me. By 
your permission I intend to accept consecration. 
Then parents became very sad and said to Atimuktakumara-O son! Still you 
are a child. Your intelligence is undeveloped. What do you know about religion? 
Atimuktakumara replied-Parents! What I know, I do not know and what I do 
not know, I know. 
Parents said with astonishment-Son! What you know, you do not know and 
what you do not know, you know. How is it? What is its meaning? 
Atimuktakumara replied-Parents! I know that one who is born, has to die; but I 
do not know when, where, in what manner and after what length of time he will die. 
Again I do not know after what types of deeds (karmas) souls take birth in 
hellish, animal, human and god state; but I definitely know that souls take birth in 
hellish, animal, human and god state due to their own deeds (karmas). 
Hence it is definte; parents!that what I know, the same I do not know and what 
I do not know, the same I know. Therefore, parents! I intend to accept consecration 
with your permission.

When parents could not prevail upon Atimuktakumara by various reasons and 
arguments, they spoke-Son! We desire to see your royal splendor may be for even 
one day i.e. we want to coronate you. 
Then Atimuktakumara remained silent at the words of his parents. Then his 
anointment ceremony was celebrated like Mahabala. Then he accepted consecration 
in presence of Bhagavana Mahavira, studied Samayika etc., eleven Holy Scriptures 
(angas), practiced sage conduct for many years and observed Gunaratna 
Samvatsara austerity until he was beatified on Vipulagiri. 
Commentary: - 
Besides this life sketch of Atimuktakumara as related in Antakrddasa Sutra, 
we also find one event in Bhagavati Sutra Being interesting, necessary and 
important we are giving here the transliteration of original text of that episode. 
Disciple of Shramana Bhagavana Mahavira was sage Atimuktakumara. He 
was gentle and humble by nature. Once it rained cats and dogs. As rain stopped 
Atimuktakumara went for discharging stool and urine in an open land taking his holy 
broom and utensil with him. 
In the way he saw a small rivulet full of water. First of all he made the fence of 
clay to stop the flow of water. After that as the sailor moves his boat in water of a 
river, in the same way he placed his utensil on the water of that small rivulet and 
began to float that utensil, uttering-“this is my boat, this my boat.” Thus sage 
Atimuktakumara began to play. 
Seeing sage Atimuktakumara thus playing, the aged sages, speaking nothing 
to him, directly approached Shramana Bhagavana Mahavira and bowing down and 
worshipping him, asked- 
Bhagawan! After how many births will your disciple sage Atimuktakumara 
attain salvation? 
Bhagavana told-My disciple sage Atimuktakumara will attain liberation in this 
very life span and end all miseries. It is his last physical body. Therefore you must 
not regret, abuse and disgrace him, but serve him with decorum, help him and give 
assistance in food etc., Atimuktakumara is going to exhaust his all karmas and attain 
salvation in this very life span. 
Hearing all this, those aged sages bowed down and worshipped Bhagavana 
and then began to look after sage Atimuktakumara. 
 
 
 [40] Meaning-  
Arya Jambu said-Bhagawan! I have heard the subject matter of fifteenth 
chapter. What has Bhagavana described in sixteenth chapter? Kindly tell me. 
Sudharma Swami began to narrate-At that time and at that period, there was 
a Kama Mahavana garden in Varanasi city. Alaksa was the king of Varanasi. 
At that time and at that period, Shramana Bhagavana Mahavira arrived at that 
garden. Public congregation went out for bowing down to Bhagavana. 
King Alaka also became glad as he heard that Bhagavana Mahavira had 
come and like king Konika he also beagn to serve and worship Bhagavana 
Mahavira. Bhagavana delivered religious discourse. 
Then like Udayana, king Alaksa accepted sage consecration, in presence of 
Shramana Bhagavana Mahavira. Accepting; he coronated his eldest son.

[48…] Meaning-  
Jambu Swami asked-If Bhagavana described ten chapters in eighth section 
then what had he told in first chapter? Kindly tell me. 
Sudharma Swami told- O Jambu! At that time and at that period, there was a 
city named Campa, a sanctuary of Purnabhadra deity, King Konika was ruling. There 
was a queen named Kali, consort of Shrenika and younger step mother of Konika. 
She accepted consecration, like queen Nanda. She studied Samayika etc., 
eleven Holy Scriptures (angas) and began to wander engrossing her soul with one 
day fast, two days’ fast, three days’ fast, etc. and various types of penances. 
[48] Commentary: - 
In the description of queen Nanda etc., the names of king Srenika and 
Rajagrha city are given and here Campa city and king Konika are referred. It clearly 
shows that this description of queen Kali etc., is after the death of king Srenika. 
Being in sorrow at the death of his father Srenika, King Konika left Rajagrha and 
made Campa his capital. So these episodes of queens Kali etc., happened after the 
death of king Shrenika. 
The event which excited the apathy of kali etc., according to Nirayavalika 
Sutra, is as follows- 
Monarch of Magadha. King Srenika, in his life time, had given two valuable 
things as gift-1.Necklace given by god (Devanami hara) and 2.Elephant Sechanaka 
or Sechanaka, to the two younger sons, named Halla and Vihalla born of queen 
Celana. Both princes, enjoining these things, with their hearemes, were living in 
pleasure. The inhabitants of Campa city used to praise their happy life, necklace and 
elephant, saying that-verily Halla and Vihalla Kumaras are enjoying the royality 
(rajya-laksmi), king Konika is only bearing the burden of kingdom. 
Padmavati, the chief queen of Konika heard these views of public then she 
requested her husband king Konika-Necklace and elephant-both are the signs of 
kingdom, therefore, these are for you only.

Konika replied-My father had given these two valuable things-Necklace and 
elephant-to my younger brothers, so it is not proper to ask these things from them. 
But chief queen Padmavati insisted then under compulsion, Konika ordered 
his younger brothers to return that necklace and elephant. 
Princes Halla and Vihalla gave a polite answer-Elder brother ! If you want to 
take these things, then please give us a part of kingdom. 
Konika denied the division of kingdom, and tried to take necklace and 
elephant by force. 
Halla-Vihalla knew the scheme of Konika. Then they stealthily ran away to 
their maternal grandfather king Chetaka taking with them all their army, treasure, 
seraglio, necklace and elephant. When Konika came to know that Halla-Vihalla had 
stealthily run away from Campa city then he was filled with wrath. He had sent 
message to his maternal grand gather to send back princes Halla-Vihalla with divine 
necklace and Sincanaka elephant. Chetaka was a just man. He replied that if Konika 
gives half of his kingdom to princes Halla and Vihalla then he could accept the 
proposal. 
Denying this propsed Konika attacked vaisali capital city of Chetaka. With king 
Konika his ten step brothers Kalikumara etc., came as army-commanders in battle 
field. Millions of men were killed these ten brothers were killed by the arrows of 
Chetaka. 
During this period Bhagavana arrived at Campa city. All the queens Kali and 
others asked Bhagavana- Can we see the faces of our sons, when they return from 
battle field or not? The Lord told that their sons had died in war. 
Hearing this all the ten queens thought that life is momentary, so disinclined to 
world, became consecrated.

after each fast three days’ fast, took meals; two days’ fast, took meals; one day fast 
and then took meals of all the four types according to her desire and need. 
Thus Arya Kali completed one series of Ratnavali penance. This one series of 
Ratnavali penance took one year, three months and twentytwo days to complete. In 
this series there were three hundred eightyfour days of penance and eightyeight 
days of taking meal. 
After that Arya Kali began the second series of Ratnavali penance. She 
observed one day fast, breaking one day fast penance she took meals devoid of 
milk, curd, ghee, oil and sweet-vigayas. After that she observed two days’ fast and 
then took meals without all the five vigayas and so on. In this second series she 
avoided all the five vigayas. 
Thus second series she observed like first series. Excepting; vigayas were not 
taken. The order of penance is the same as that of first series. 
After this Kali Arya observed third series of fast. In it took she meals without 
smearing of vigayas. All else was same as first series. She also practiced fourth 
series. In this on the day she took meals, she practiced fourth series. In this on the 
day she took meals, she practiced ayambila penance. Rest is the same.  
[…49] Meaning-  
Meaning of Couplet-In the first series all types of meals according to desire 
and need .In the second taking meals devoid of vigayas.In the third taking meals 
even without smearing of vigayas; and in the fourth observing of Ayambila in stead of 
meal taking. 
 [50] Meaning-  
Thus Kali Arya propiliated complete Ratnavali penance. It took five years, two 
months and twentyeight days to perform. After practicing this penance in due order, 
she came to Arya Chandana and bowed down and worshipped her. 
Thereafter Kali Arya began to wander engrossed her soul in various kinds of 
fast penances like-one day, two days’, three days’, four days’, five days’ etc 
Due to these hard and rigorous penances Kali Arya became lean and thin. 
Her veins became visible clearly-meaning blood and flesh of her body had dried up 
and her body was reduced to skeleton of bones only. As the cart full of coal makes 
sound while moving, so was the position of her body. Moving, sitting, standing, her 
bones made the sound of cracking, i.e., khada-khada still then, as the sacrificial fire, 
and fire covered by ashes, remains burning inside; so by the flames of penance the 
body of Arya Kali was full of lustre. 
Again, and day, like monk Skandaka, these thoughts arose in the mind of 
Arya Kali-Though my body has become lean, thin and reduced, yet, until, in my body 
are utthana, karma, bala, virya, purusakara and parakrama; faith, steadiness and 
detachment in mind; it would be proper forme that the next day after sun rise I should 
go to Arya Chandana and taking her permission accept Samthara, renounce food, 
water and every kind of meals, not wishing death (becoming devoid of the wish of life 
and death), fix myself in soul virtues. 
Thinking thus, next day as the sun rose Arya Kali approached Arya 
Chandana, Bowing down and worshipping her she said- 
“O Arye! If you allow me, I want to accept Samlekhana-Jhusana.  
Arya Chandana allowing her request, said: O beloved as gods! Do as you feel 
happy; but do not delay in auspicious deeds.

Getting permission of Arya Chandana, Arya Kali accepted last penance of 
fast-starvation and emancipation (Samlekhana-jhusana). 
Arya Kali had learnt Samayhika etc., eleven Holy Scriptures (angas) from 
Arya Chandana (before) and completed eight years of sage-conduct period. She 
emaciated (exhausting all karma, making her soul pure), by cutting off sixty meals 
and accepting restrain. With her last breath, she became beatified, emancipated and 
ended all miseries. 
 
 
[51] Meaning-  
Arya Jambu Swami said-O Bhagawan! What was the subject matter 
expressed by the Lord in the second chapter of eighth section? Please tell me. 
Sudharma Swami told-O Jambu! At that time and at that period there was a 
city named Campa. In it there was situated Purnabhadra garden (sanctuary). King 
Konika was ruling there. There lived queen Sukali consort of king Srenika and 
younger step mother of king Konika. 
Sukali also accepted consecration like queen Kali and began to wander 
engrossing her soul by many types of fast penances. 
Then one day Arya Sukali came to Arya Cadana and spoke-O Arye! If you 
permit me I intend to wander practicing Kanakavali penance. 
Getting permission of chief nun Arya Chandana, Arya Sukali practiced 
Kanakavali penance, like penance of Ratnavali, excepting; on the three occasionshe 
practiced three days’ fast, while in Ratnavali two days’ fast was practiced. It takes 
the period of one year, five months and twelve days to complete on series. 
In this one series eightyeight days are of taking meals and one year, two 
months, fourteen days are of fast. 
Time period of all the four series is of five years, nine months eighteen days. 
Remaining description is similar to that of Arya Kali. Practising nun-conduct 
upto nine years, she became beatified. 
 
 
[52] Meaning-  
Jambu Swami asked Sudharma Swami-O Bhagawan! What was subject 
matter told by Bhagavana in the third chapter of eighth section? 
Sudharma Swami told-O Jambu! In the third chapter, there is the description 
of queen Mahakali. She was consort of king Srenika and younger step mother of 
king Konika. She accepted consecration like queen Sukali and practiced Laghu 
Singhaniskridita penance. 
Details of that penance are like this. First of all she practiced one day fast 
then took meals (In the first series of vigayas.) After breaking fast next day she 
practiced two days’ fast and took meals, then one day fast penance, next day took 
meals. Then three days’ fast and took meals. Then, she practiced two, four, three,

One series took the time period of six months and seven days. Among them 
thirty three days were of taking meals and five months, three days were of fast 
penance. 
Thus, Mahakali Arya practiced four series of this penance and it took two 
years and twentyeight days. 
In this way, Mahakali ARya practiced smaller lion’s play (Laghu singha 
nskridita) penance in aforesaid manner. Afterwards she practiced various types of 
miscellaneous penances. In the fag end of her life she accepted samthara and 
exhausting all the karmas became beatified. 
Commentary: - 
Arya Mahakali practiced Laghu-singha-niskridita penance, which is mentioned 
in present sutra as khuddaga Siha nikkiliyam. It denotes that as the lion. While 
walking, visualizes the path he has passed by turning back and then moves forward-
that is called as retrospection. In the same way, during this penance the practiser 
moving forward jumps in due order, then returns and practices that e.g. a penance 
observing 5 days’ fast jumps on 7 days’ fast he returns and practices 6 days’ fast. 
Singha-niskridita penance is of two kinds-1. Laghu singha-niskridita penance 
and 2.Maha-singha niskridita penance.Described in present chapter Arya Mahakali 
propiliated Laghu Singha niskridita penance. As described in next chapter Arya 
Krushna practised Maha Singha-niskridita penance. 
 
 
[53] Meaning-  
In the same way we should understand the fourth chapter, relating to queen 
Krushna. Excepting; KRsna Arya practised Maha singha niskridita (greater lions’ 
play) penance. Difference of this penance from Laghu singha-niskridita penance is 
that in this penance it is carried upto 16 days’ fast in ascending order and then it is 
carried down upto one day fast in descending order. One series takes time period of 
one year, six months, eighteen days. So all the four series are completed in six 
years, two months, twelve days. 
Remaining description is similar to that of Kali ARya. In the later period, she 
accepted Samthara and attained salvation like Kali Arya.  
 
 
Arya Sukrushna; Propiliation of Sage (Nun)-Resolution 
Similarly should be known the description of Sukrsnadevi, in fifth chapter. She 
was also the consort of king Srenika and younger step mother of king Konika. 
Having heard the sermon of Bhagavana Mahavira, she accepted sage (nun) 
consecration. Excepting; she began to wander, accepting seven-seven sage (nun) 
resolution penance with the permission of Arya Chandanabala. 
Its method is as follows- 
During first week (seven days) one dole (datti meaning unbroken flow of food 
and water given by a giver) of food and one dole (datti) of water is accepted every 
day. During second week two doles of meals and two doles of water. During third 
week three-three, in fourth four-four, in fifth five-five in sixth six-six and in seventh

Thus in these fortynine days, one hundred ninentysix doles of alms are taken 
by practiser. 
Sukrsna Arya practised sapt-saptamika seven-sevens in proper way sage 
firm-resolution according to the schedule of sutras. During first week, there become 
seven doles of meals and water combinedly, during second week fourteen, in third 
twentyone, in fourth twentyeight, in fifth thirty five, in sixth fortytwo, in seventh 
fortynine. Totalling all these there became one hundred ninetysix dattis-doles. (See 
table 6) 
Thus practicing this firm resolution (pratima) penance according to the 
schedule of sutra Arya Sukrsna went to Arya Chandanabala bowed down and 
worshipped her and then she said- 
O Arye! I intend to wander, accepting eight-eight (sage) firm resolution, if you 
permit me. 
Arya Chandana spoke-O beloved of gods!Do, as it please you; but do not be 
negligent in religious deeds. 
Then Arya Sukrsna getting the permission of Arya penance and began to 
wander. 
During this penance in the first eight days one dole of meals and one dole of 
water is taken everyday, in second eight days two doles of meals and water is taken. 
In this order in the eight days eight doles of meals and eight doles of water is taken. 
In all, this penance takes sixty four days to perform and total doles combined meals 
and water are two hundred eightyeight each. Arya Sukrsna performed this penance 
according to the schedule of sutra in due order. 
After this, with the permission of Arya Chandana she accepted nun firm 
resolution penance of nine-nines. During first nine days she took one dole of meals 
and one dole of water everyday. In this order she took nine doles of meals and nine 
doles of water in ninth-nine penance, for nine days. 
In all, this penance took eightyone days to perform and total doles, counting 
both meals and water, were four hundred five each. Arya Sukrsna performed this 
nun firm resolution nine-nine penance according to schedule prescribed in sutras.  
Then Arya Sukrsna accepted the nun firm resolution penance of ten-tens. 
During the first ten days she took one dole of meals and one dole of water everyday. 
Then increasing it she took ten doles of meals and ten doles of water everyday in the 
last ten days of this penance. This penance was completed in one hundred days and 
the total number of doles, counting doles of meals and water both, becomes five 
hundred fifty each.  
Thus she practised this nun firm-resolution. Penances according to the 
schedule prescribed in sutras. 
Then Arya Sukrsna began to wander engrossing her soul with various types 
of penances like-one day fast and increasing upto fortnight and full month’s fast 
penances. Due to these rigorous penances she became too weak. At the fat end of 
life she accepted samthara and exhausting all karmas became beatified. 
 
 
[55] Meaning-  
In same way, consort of king Srenika and younger step mother of king Konika, 
queen Mahakrsna also accepted consecration in presence of Bhagavana Mahavira.

Arya Mahakrushna with the permission of Arya Chandana began to practice 
Laghu Sarvatobhadra penance. The method of this penance is as follows- 
First of all she observed one day fast and next day broke it up, took food 
without renouncing vigayas. Then observed two days’ fast, in the same way 
observed three days’, four days; five days’ fast, again observed three days’, four 
days’, five days’, one day and two days’ fast penance. Then observed five days’, one 
day, two days’, three days’ and four days’ fast. Then observed two days’, three days’ 
four day’, five days’ and one day fast, again four days’ five days’ one day’, two days’ 
and three days’ fast. Thus Arya Mahakrsna completed the first series of small 
Sarvatobhadra penance.  
This first series takes the time period of three months and ten days. 
Practising this series according to schedule prescribed by Sutras and in due 
order Arya Mahakrsna observed one day’ fast in second series of this penance and 
took food avoiding vigayas. 
As four series are told in Ratnavali penance, so are the four series in this 
penance also. Taking food should also be known similar to that one. 
The first series was performed in one hundred days, among these twentyfive 
days were of taking meals and seventyfive days were of fast penance. Same is the 
number of days in second, third and fourth series. Thus the time period of all the four 
series is one year one month and ten days. 
In first series she took meals without renouncing vigayas, in second avoiding 
vigayas, in third even without smearing of vigayas and in fourth taking of ayambila 
gruel. In this way Arya Mahakrsna propiliated this penance according to the schedule 
prescribed in sutras. In the later period of life she accepted samlekhana- samthara, 
exhausted all the karmas and was liberated, beatified, completely free of all miseries. 
Commentary: - 
Khuddiya Savvaobhaddam Padimam-In this phrase word khuddiya (Sanskrta 
from Ksullaka) is given. It is in comparison to great (mahad). Really word Ksullaka 
means small or smaller than that, i.e., mahad. Thus (Sarvatobhadra) penance is of 
two kinds-one great and another small. Here described penance is small; to make 
clear this the word Ksullaka (small) is given. 
The figures counted from any side or all sides horizontal or vertical, the sum 
total of figures should be the same that is called magic square. In this small fivefold  
(magic square) one to five figures are given. Counting all these numbers from any 
side the total we get is fifteen. 
As clarified by figures the penance practice penance in the same way e.g., 
one day fast, two days’ fast upto five days’ fast. So this penance has been termed as 
magic square or sarvatobhadra penance. 
This can be clearly understood by the square given here. 
 
 
[56] Meaning-  
Likewise the life-sketch of queen Virakrushna should be known. She was also 
consort of king Srenika and younger step mother of king Konika. She also accepted 
consecration and with the permission of Arya Canadanabala practised greatmagic 
square (Maha sarvatobhadra) penance. 
The method of this penance is like this-

First of all she observed one day fast then two days’ fast and in this order 
three days’, four days’, five days’, six days’ and seven days’ fast penance was 
observed. It became first branch. 
Then, she observed four days’ fast, took meals and further in this order

Then, she observed three days’ fast, took meals and in the aforesaid order 
she observed four days’, five days’, six days’, seven days’, one day and two days’ 
fast. It is fourth branch. 
Then in aforesaid order practicing fast penance and in between taking meals

This first series was completed in eight months and five days. Among them 
she took meals in fortynine days and penance one hundred ninetysix days. During 
this first series vigayas were not avoided while taking meals. Taking meals in second 
series vigayas were avoided, in third series seven the smearing of vigayas was

chapters. She also was the consort of king Srenika and younger step mother of king 
Konika. She accepted consecration and with the permission of Aryaa Chandanabala, 
practised Bhadrottara Pratima penance. In Bhadrottara pratima the word Bhadrottara 
is composed by two words-Bhadra and uttara. Bhadra means welfare and uttara 
denotes chief. Thus the whole word Bhadrottara means-giver of chief and utmost 
welfare or salvation to the soul. That is as follows- 
First of all she observed 5 days’ fast, took meal. Then observed 6 days’ fast, 
took meals; then seven, eight, nine days’ fast, took meals in between.It’s first branch. 
Then she observed seven, eight, nine, five and six days’ fast.

All these five branches made a series. Such four series are in this penance. 
One series took six months and twenty days. So all the four series were completed 
in two years, two months and twenty days. 
During first series vigayas were not renounced in meals, in second vigayas 
were avoided, in third even smearing of vigayas was avoided and in fourth ayambila 
was observed on day meant for taking meals after fast. 
Arya Ramakrsna practised this penance in due order. Like Arya Kali 
exhausting all karmas, she was beatified.  
 
 
[58] Meaning-  
So is description of Pitrasenakrushna. She was the consort of king Shrenika 
and younger step mother of king Konika. She accepted consecration and propiliated 
Muktavali penance with the permission of Arya Chandanabala. That is as follows- 
First of all she observed one day’ fast then took meals; (in this first series 
vigayas are not excluded in meals) then she observed two days’ fast, took meals; 
then one day fast, took meals; then three days’ fast. In this way, observing one day’ 
fast in between Arya Pitrasenakrsna ascended upto fifteen days’ fast then one day  
fast, again sixteen days’ fast and after it, again sixteen days’ fast, one day’ fast took 
meals and then again she observed one day’ fast. 
Then, likewise, according to Pascanupurvi (i.e. to go forward and then come 
backward and then again to go forward) and in between observing one day’ fast, as 
she ascended, in the same way descended from fifteen days’ fast to one day’ fast in 
due order. 
Thus, she completed one series of Muktavali penance. 
Like Kali Arya, she completed four series of this fast penance. 
One series of this penance took eleven months and fifteen days to complete 
.So four series were completed in three years and ten months. Among them were 
eleven hundred forty (1140) days of penance and 240 days of taking meals.  
In the end she accepted samlekhana-samthuru and was emancipated. 
 
 
[59] Meaning-  
Same is the description of queen Mahasenakrushna. She also was the 
consort of king Srenika and younger step mother of king Konika. She accepted 
consecration and with the permission of Arya Chandanabala, she practised Ayambila 
Vardhamana penance. That is as follows-

and next day one fast, then three ayambilas and next day fast, then four ayambilas, 
next day fast, then five ayambilas, next day fast, then six ayambilas and next day 
fast; in this way increasing one ayambila and in between fast, she practised one 
hundred ayambilas and then fast. Thus she completed Ayambila Vardhamana 
penance. 
Thus Arya Mahasenakrushna completed Ayambila Vardhamana penance in 
fourteen years, three months and twenty days according to the schedule prescribed 
by sutras and in proper manner. Among this, the days of ayambilas are - 5050  and

.         Thus total days are 5150. In this penance, there is only ascending; and no 
descending. In this penance fourteen years and ten days are of Ayambila and hun-
dred days are of fast.                                                                                               .             
.          After this Arya Mahasenakrushna went to Arya Chandanabala and bowed to 
her. Then she (Arya Mahasenakrsna) began to wander engrossing her soul by many 
types of penances e.g., fast etc. She became too weak due to those rigorous 
penances but she seemed lustrous by the internal flame of austerities.                  .          
.         Once, in the last hours of night, like Skandaka, Arya Mahasenakrsna 
pondered deeply-though my body has become lean, thin and reduced, yet, until, in 
my body are utthana, bala, virya etc., it would be proper for me that, as the sun rises 
I go to Arya Chandanabala, bowed down respected her, and asked her permission 
for samthara. Getting permission she accepted samthara and without desire of 
death, she engrossed herself in auspicious-religious meditation.                            .   .    
.            Arya Mahasenakrushna learnt Samayika etc. (six essentials), and eleven 
holy scriptures (angas) from Arya Chandanabala, practised nun-conduct upto 17 
years and engrossing her soul by one month’s santhara, cutting off sixty meals, 
exhausting all karmas, with her last breath became emancipated, attained salvation.

◙ Something about This Publication ◙ 
 
 We have already published 45 Aagams in Four languages Prakrut, 
Sanskrut (Satik), Hindi and Gujarati.  Now a day for new generation & abroad 
living people, English translation has become a necessity.  So we have planned to 
translate or compile Jain-Aagam in English. We gave priority to ‘Nandi Sootra’.       
After that we have worked for ‘Niryaavalika panchak’. Thus six Aagam have 
been completed. It is said that Nirayaavalikaadi five Aagams are respectly Upang 
of Upaasakdasa aadi five ANG-Sootra. So we thaught to compile these Angsootra 
and as aresult of that, Vipakshrut is compiled; now we are going to present Ang 
sootra-9 ‘Anuttaropapaatikdasha’ before you. During this translation of these two 
Ang-sootra one Prakirnak named ‘VEERSTAVA’ is also translated in to English. 
 
 
ANUTTAROPAPAATIKDASHA is an “Ang-Pavitth” Aagam, Nandi 
Sootra, Suyagadang Sootra etc. Narrates ‘Anuttaropapaatik sootra’ as an ninth 
Ang-Sootra of Aagam. AbhaydevSuri has written Vrutti [commentary] on this sootr. 
Here, we have compiled Translation done by Surendra Bothara, which is 
originally edited in to Hindi by Shree Amar-Muni & Shree Chandra Surana, We 
have  two motives for publishing this book.—[1] To provide Aagam literature in 
English & [2] It should be given in Microsoft Word format so people can do Cut, 
Paste & Editing by themselves also. 
At present this Book is published as a Net-Publication with the help of the 
Jain Education International organization of America.  In future we may publish it 
as a Book also. We are also planning to put more Aagams in English before you. 
We also invite learned persons to translate more & more ‘authentic Jain 
literature in English for kids and youths, so the ignorant-people of regional 
languages can also read or learn our “Shashtra & Granth”. 
 
We are very much thankful to Shree Pravinbhai, Sudeshbhai, Late Mr. 
Krupal Shah and all other known-unknown persons who helpd us for this project 
directly or indirectly.

--► varga [part]-1 ◄-- 
Φ Gist of the Chapter:- 
Antakrid-dasha Sutra is eighth Anga among eleven Anga Sutras. It contains 
life-story of ninety great saints who attained liberation from the vicious circle of life 
and death. Thereafter, in the ninth Anga Sutra—Anuttaraupapatik-dasha Sutra the 
conduct and superb austerities of thirty three great men has been discussed in brief 
who by their exemplary conduct destroyed their past Karmas to a great extent but 
not completely. As such they could not attain liberation from life and death in that 
very life. They had to be reborn in Anuttar Viman—the abode of extremely super 
class of angels. 
This Sutra has three Vargs (Parts). In first part there are ten chapters. Each of 
the ten chapters describes the life-story of one spiritual seeker. 
In the ten chapters of the first Varg, the life of ten sons of king Shrenik has 
been narrated. They discarded the royal enjoyments in the very youth and accepted 
initiation near Bhagavan Mahavir. They went through many austerities and purified 
their soul. In this part, there are no separate detailed descriptions of each ascetic but 
the life of all the ten is described in brief. 
 
 
[1] Meaning- At that time (the last part of the fourth epoch of there gressive cycle of 
time) during that period (when Arya Sudharma was alive), there was a city called 
Rajagriha. Arya Sudharma came there. People came to see him and tolisten to his 
spiritual discourse.' After the discourse thecongregation dispersed. Jambu Swami 
was with Sudharma Swami observing his ascetic code of conduct. Once came near 
Arya Sudharma Swami, bowed to him with respect and inquired 
""Bhante! I have grasped the meaning of the eighth Anga—Antagad-dasha as 
explained by Shraman Bhagavan Mahavir. Now please tell me what is the meaning 
of this ninth Anga—Anuttaraupapatik-dasha Sutra?” 
Sudharma Swami said—""Jambu ! Shraman Bhagavan Mahavir has narrated 
Anuttraupapatik-dasha Sutra inthree Vargs (Parts)."" 
Jambu said---""Bhante ! How many chapters are in the first part as described 
by Bhagavan Mahavir ?""Sudharma Swami said-----""Jambu! Bagavan Mahavir has 
mentioned ten chapters in the first Varg. They are as under— 
          (1) Jali Kumar,  (2) Mayali Kumar,  (3) Uvayali Kumar, (4) Purushsen Kumar 
(5) VarishenKumar, (6) Deerghdant Kumar(7) LashtdantKumar,(8) Vehalla Kumar, 
(9) Vehayas Kumar, and (10) Abhay Kumar.""

Arya Jambu said--""Bhante! Since Bhagavan Mahavir has mentioned ten 
chapters in the first Varg, kindly tell me the meaning of the first chapter as 
mentioned by Him."" 
Sudharma said ""Jambu! At that time during thatperiod there was a city called 
Rajagriha. It was prosperousand famous for trade and business. Gunsheelak 
Chaitya was situated there. Shrenik was its ruler and Dharini was his wife. Once 
queen Dharini saw a lion in thedream. In due course she gave birth to a son Jali 
Kumar.Like Megh Kumar, Jali Kumar was also married to eight damsels. They got 
dowry in counts of eight.' [***In chapter one of Jnata-dharma katha is the detailed description of 
Megh Kumar's marriage. Details here should also be taken as same. ***],  (eighty million gold coins, 
eighty million silver coins, etc.) 
Thereafter, Jali Kumar started spending his life in the palace enjoying all the 
pleasures of a married life. 
Once Bhagavan Mahavir came to Rajagrilla. King Shrenik came to have his 
darshan. Jali Kumar also camethere like Megh Kumar and listened to his 
spiritualdiscourse. He accepted initiation near Bhagavan Mahavirafter obtaining 
permission of his parents. He learnt eleven Anga Sutras from experienced and 
learned monks (Sthavir). 
He did Gun-ratna-Samvatsar chain of fasts like Skandak Saint.' [***This austerity 
has been described in detail in Antakrid-dasha Sutra, chapter 1***]  The detail of his meditation 
and inquiries may be understood identical to that of Skandak. He went toVipulgiri hill 
with other monks. The only difference is thatJali Kumar led the ascetic life for sixteen 
years. After end of this life-span, swiftly passing the areas of the Kalpopanaangels 
and nine Graiveyaks, he was re-born in Vijay Viman, which is an Anuttar Viman. 
Then the monks present, finding that monk Jali haddied, performed silent 
meditation in this context. Thereafter, they climbed down Vipulgiri with pots and 
clothes of Jali Kumar and came near Bhagavan Mahavir.They greeted the Lord and 
said—""Bhante! Your disciple Jali Kumar has died after observing Santhara as 
prescribed. He was gentle, humble, quiet, almost completelyfree from anger, ego, 
deceit and greed. He had humility and simplicity. He fully controlled the activities of 
his senseorgans. Here are his pots and clothes."" 
Then Gautam Swami greeted the Lord and asked--  
Gautam Swami inquired—""Bhante! Your disciple Saint Jali was extremely 
gentle. He has since died. Where has he been re-born?” 
Bhagavan Mahavir replied—""Gautam! My disciple monk Jali had accepted 
with my permission five great vows followed them strictly as prescribed and at the 
end died in Santhara (the process followed in state of consciousness before death). He re-
incarnated in great Viman known asVijay which is much higher than Sun and Moon.""   
Gautam asked—""Bhante! For how many years he shall remain there?” 
Bhagavan Mahavir said ""Gautam! His life-span is thirty two Sagaropam."" 
Gautam inquired—""After life-span as an angel where shall Jali be re-born?"" 
  
Bhagavan Mahavir replied—""Gautam! He shall be re born in Mahavideh and 
attain salvation from there."" 
 
Conclusion— the above is the detailed meaning of first chapter of the first  
Varg of Anuttaraupapatik-dasha asmentioned by Bhagavan Mahavir.

***** 
Commentary: -- The first chapter contains the description of Jali Kumar, son of king 
Shrenik, who got initiation near Bhagavan Mahavir. About similar passages in this account, the life-
story of Skandak and Megh Kumar monks has been referred to. Their life-stories can be seen in 
Bhagavatisootra Shatak-2, uddeso-1, Antakrud-dasha & Jnata-Dharma-katha Chapter-1 respectively.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
[2] Meaning- The remaining nine chapters are almost similar to the first one. 
The only difference is that Dharini was the motherof first seven namely—(1) Jali 
Kumar, (2) Mayali Kumar,(3) Uvayali Kumar, (4) Purushsen Kumar, (5) 
VarisenKumar, (6) Deerghdant Kumar and (7) Lashtdant Kumar,Chelana was the 
mother of next two namely—(8) VehallaKumar and (9) Vehayas Kumar, and Nanda 
was the mother of the last one—(10) Abhay Kumar. 
The first five led ascetic life for sixteen years each, the next three for twelve 
years each and the last two for five years each. The first five were re-born in heaven 
in Vijay, Vaijayant, Jayant, Aparajit and Sarvarth Siddh abodes respectively. 
Deerghdant was re-born in Sarvarth Siddh, Lashtdant in Aparajit, Vehalla in 
Jayant, Vehayas in Vaijayant and Abhay Kumar in Vijay Viman. The remaining 
description may, be taken as similar to that of the first chapter. 
The only special account relating to Abhay Kumar is that he belonged to 
Rajagriha and was son of king Shrenik and Nanda Devi. 
Sudharma said—""Jambu! This is the entire account of first Varg (Part) of 
Anuttaraupapatik-dasha Sutra as narrated by Bhagavan Mahavir who has since 
attained salvation."" 
Commentary: -- In the next nine chapters of the Varg, there are life-sketches 
of nine ascetics. Detailed description is not available about seven of them. Two 
princes of identical name, viz., Lashtdant Kumar have been mentioned—one is that 
who has been narrated in this Varg. His mother was Dharini, father was king Shrenik 
and he after the present life-span was re-born in Jayant Viman. The second one is 
that who has been described in the second Varg. His parents are the same but he 
was re-born in Vaijayant heaven. 
The question arises whether the same person has been discussed twice. 
After detailed study, the leanred Acharyas are of the view that the re-birth of same 
person in two different Vimans is not possible. Moreover, the first Varg has 10 
chapters and the second Varg has 13 chapters. In case we suppose that same 
person was described twice, the sum total of the persons discussed in the said two 
Vargs will be reduced by one and that is not in accordance with the scriptures. So it 
is proper to understand that there were two different persons of the same name. 
Vehalla and Vehayas were both grandsons (daughter's sons) of king Chetak. It 
was for them, that the dreadful battles of Rath-Moosal and Shila Kantak were fought 
and Konik destroyed Vaishali. His detailed account is in the commentary of 
Bhagavati Sutra, Shatak 7 and Uddeshak 9.

Abhay Kumar has been mentioned in many Agams and other connected 
literature at several places. Interesting accounts relating to his life are mentioned in 
Niryavalika Sutra, Janta Dharmkatha Sutra and in the Commentary of Nandi Sutra  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
--► varga [part]- 2 ◄-- 
Φ Gist of the Chapter:- 
In the second Varg, the austerities of thirteen great monks and their spiritual 
practice shortly before their death has been described in brief. All the said thirteen 
persons were the sons of king Shrenik. Their mother was Dharini. All of them 
accepted initiation near Bhagavan Mahavir like Jali Kumar. They studied all the 
eleven scriptures and in the end went to Vipulgiri and observing Samlekhana 
completed the life-span and were re-born in Anuttar Viman. 
There is no important event relating to their life finding mention in the 
scriptures. It appears that the purpose of the narrator of scriptures must have been 
to describe their ascetic and spiritual practices. Their life-style and worldly comforts 
were similar to those Jali Kumar had. 
 
 
 
[3] Meaning- Jambu Swami inquired of Sudharma Swami—Bhante! I have 
grasped the meaning of the first Varg ofAnuttaraupapatik Sutra. Please tell me the 
meaning of the second Varg as narrated by Bhagavan Mahavir."" 
Sudharma Swami replied—""Jambu – Bhagavan Mahavir, since liberated, had 
narrated thirteen chapters of the second Varg. They are—

town called Rajagriha. Gunsheelak chaitya was there. King Shrenik was ruling there. 
Dharini was his queen. Once she saw a lion in dream. The birth, the childhood, the 
education, etc., may be considered similar to that of Jali Kumar. The only difference 
is that the name ofthe child born was Deerghsen.

Remaining account is similar to that of Jali Kumar and that in the end he 
attained salvation. 
Thus, all the thirteen princes were residents’ of Rajagriha. Their parents were 
king Shrenik and queen Dharini. All the thirteen led ascetic life for sixteen years 
each. After completing their life-span, Deerghsen and Mahasen were born in Vijay 
Viman, Lashtdant andGoodhdant in Vaijayant Viman, Shuddhadant and Halla in 
Jayant Viman, Drum and Drumsen in Aparajit Viman andthe remaining five namely 
Mahadrumsen and others in Sarvarth Siddh Viman. 
Jambu! This is the meaning of the entire second Varg asnarrated by 
Bhagavan Mahavir."" In both Vargs, the period of Samlekhana is one month each. 
(It is worth mentioning that all the twenty three monks mentioned in the two Vargs had left 
food and remained motionless like a cut-off branch of a tree for a period of one month each. After 
completing their life-span, they were re born in Anuttar Vimans.) 
Commentary-- Here the life-sketch of the thirteen monks has been described 
in a very concise form. The description has been concluded by referring to the 
description of Megh Kumar in Jnata Dharmakatha Sutra and that their account is 
similar to that of Megh Kumar. So for detailed study, kindly see first chapter of Jnata 
Dharmakatha Sutra. 
In the first Varg, the mother of seven monks is Dharini; here also the mother 
of thirteen monks is Dharini. In Jnata Dharmakatha, the mother of Megh Kumar is 
Dharini. It is therefore, worth a study whether twenty one wives of king Shrentik were 
of the same name Dharini or Dharni was not the name of the mother but denotes 
their quality, i.e., one who bears is Dharini. In other words, it may be that the mothers 
were different but a common name Dharini has been mentioned. This is a matter for 
detailed study and research.

Φ Gist of the Chapter:- 
In the third Varg (Part) of Anuttaraupapatik-dasha there is description of ten 
great ascetics engaged in self-realization. The first chapter—Dhanya Kumar' gives a 
detailed account of ascetic Dhanya. 
There is a detailed description of entirely comfortable, well-to-do family life of 
Dhanya Kumar. This narration indicates how a young man brought up in extremely 
great comforts, in a rich family, enjoying all the worldly comforts and luxuries, 
became spiritually awakened by just one spiritual discourse of Bhagavan Mahavir. 
He immediately discarded all the worldly comforts and the family life and accepted

the most difficult ascetic path. It depicts that the said person must have been highly 
conscious of spirituality, master of his decisions and saturated with the essence of 
detachment. From the very day of initiation, he decided to do two day fast and to 
break the fast with Ayambil through out his life. Thereafter, he thoroughly studied all 
the eleven Anga Sutras and after completing the study in the shortest possible time, 
he engaged himself in hard spiritual practices. The extremely weak physical health 
and the feeble state of his body have been described in a thought-provoking manner. 
The description is so lively that it inspires the reader and the listener to such an 
extent that he cannot help appreciating the spiritual practices of Dhanya Muni. 
The similes used to explain the dried parts of the body of Dhanya Muni are 
wonderful and they bring before the reader a lively picture of the highly weakened 
physical state of that ascetic engaged in serious practices. In Indian literature, long 
ascetic practices and endurance for troubles in monks are mentioned at several 
places, but the manner in which every part of ascetic Dhanya's body and the similes 
used to describe them are unique. Such a heart-rending description is not available 
anywhere else. In Buddhist literature, in Mahasinghnad Sutra of Majjhim-nikaya, the 
entirely serious self-restraint of Mahatma Buddha has been narrated in a lucid 
manner. His physical body had become so weak that it looked like a bundle of wood-
sticks. It is heard that an idol of Buddha has been discovered in sitting posture and 
all of his joints and, nerves are so much protruding that they can be counted. His 
stomach is like a deep pit. It shows that the person who saw Dhanya Muni in flesh 
and blood described him correctly by appropriate similes. Further chapters mention 
the spiritual practitioners briefly. The scriptures have laid emphasis only on ascetic 
practices and penance. The narration has been made brief by referring to Megh 
Kumar, Jamali, Skandak Anagar and Thavachchaputra. All of them have been 
described in detail in Antakrid-dasha Mahima and can be studied therefrom.

chapters in Anuttaropapatik-dasha, what is the meaning of the first chapter?” 
Sudharma Swami said—Jambu! At that time during that period, there was a 
town named Kakandi. That town was very prosperous and flourishing in trade. There 
was a Sahasraamra-Van garden which was always full of flowers and fruits (in all the 
seasons). King Jitshatru was the ruler of Kakandi. 
In Kakandi a rich lady Bhadra was residing. She was prosperous, influential 
and commanded great respect in society.

She had a son named Dhanya Kumar. He was handsome and well-built. He 
was brought up by five nurses including one providing him milk. 
At the adolescent stage Dhanya Kumar became expert in all the seventy two 
types of arts like Mahabal Kumar.He became fit to enjoy all the worldly enjoyments. 
When Bhadra noticed that Dhanya Kumar has crossed the stage of childhood 
and has grown up""and is fit to enter worldly life, she got constructed for him thirty two 
palaces that were spacious and of great height. In the centre of thesaid palaces, she 
got made a grand building standing on many pillars. 
Thereafter, she got arranged marriage of his son DhanyaKumar with thirty two 
girls of respectable families in oneday. They got thirty two things each from their 
parents’ inmarriage. They started living in the grand building wherein there was echo 
of drums and music. They were enjoying worldly pleasures with Dhanya Kumar. 
Commentary: -- The description of Kakandi in this chapter may be 
understood as narrated in Antakrid-dasha. In ancient times, the description of many 
ladies of the same name Bhadra is found. Shalibhadra's mother was Bhadra; she 
was the wife of Gobhadra, a nobleman in Rajagriha. In chapter 3 of Upasak-dasha 
Sutra, the mother of Chulanipita Shramanopasak was also Bhadra Sarthuahi. These 
facts indicate that the word Sarthuahi was used for those respectable ladies who had 
special expertise in running and protecting their household. With their unique 
acumen they were influential even in trade and business. 
The description about Mahabal Kumar is in Shatak 11 of Bhagavati Sutra. It is 
also narrated in brief in Antakrid-dasha. After going through the account of his 
childhood, his play-things, his educational interests, his marriage when he attained 
youth, and his prosperous and rich environment, it appears that Bhadra Sarthvahi 
also provided all those comforts to her son Dhanya Kumar. She married him 
simultaneously with thirty two girls of respectable families. She gave ornaments and 
clothes of various types to them. She provided beddings, maids, servants and other 
things of comfort which were of thirty two different types to each of them. This fact 
shows that Bhadra Sarthvahi was very rich and had a large heart to provide things of 
comfort and worldly enjoyment to her son. It also reflects that she had expert 
knowledge of such items. This narration further indicates that Dhanya Kumar was 
leading an extremely comfortable and well-to-do life. 
Interesting account of things of worldly comforts and grandeur is available in 
MeghKumar chapter-1 of Jnata-Dharma & in Rajprashniya in context of king Pradesi. 
In rich families, five nurses were engaged to look after the child. They were—
(1) Ksheer Dhatri—one who provides milk, (2) Majjan Dhatri—one who bathes the 
child, (3) Mandan Dhatri—one who dresses up the child, (4) Kreeda Dhatri—one 
who plays with the child, (5) Ank Dhatri—one who keeps the baby in her lap. Dhanya 
Kumar was nursed by five ladies (nurses). He learnt many skills including music, 
dance, horse riding, wrestling, archery, etc., from his teacher. 
[10] Meaning- At that time during that period once Bhagavan Mahavir came to 
Kakandi. King Jitshatru went like kingKonik to have his Darshan. Dhanya Kumar also 
came out of his house to have the Darshan of Bhagavan Mahavir in the same way 
as Jamali did. The only difference is that DhanyaKumar went there on foot.

The main point of difference as compared to Jamali is that Dhanya Kumar 
after hearing spiritual discourseof Bhagavan Mahavir, requested him""O Devanupriya! 
I want to get initiated near you after obtaining permission of my mother Bhadra."" 
After returning to his house, he talked to his mother in the same manner as 
Jamali had done to seek permission for initiation. Mother Bhadra fainted due to her 
deep attachment for her son when she heard the request of Dhanya Kumar. When 
she regained her senses there was detailed dialogue between Bhadra and Dhanya, 
wherein she referred to him hardships in monkhood and gave several reasons for 
the same. When Bhadra found that she was unable to change mind of his son as 
had been in case of Mahabal Kumar, she gave him permission to get initiated. 
Just  as Thavachchaputra's mother had sought permission of KrishnaVasudev 
for the initiation ceremonyof her son, and borrowed Chhatra and Chamar (umbrella 
and whisk), Bhadra sought the same from king Jitshatru.Just as Krishna Vasudev 
himself arranged for the initiationceremony of Thavachchaputra with great pomp and 
show, in the same way, king Jitshatru arranged initiation of DhanyaKumar at state 
expense. 
After initiation, Dhanya Kumar became an ascetic.He followed all precautions 
(Vivek) relating to moving about (Iriya Samiti) and other ascetic activities. He silently 
followed all the vows with great care. 
 
Commentary: -- In the present Sutra, the description is extremely brief and 
special occasions are referred to as the same as had been in the case of certain 
persons already mentioned (in this or other context). Dhanya Kumar's going to 
Bhagavan Mahavir for his darshan is referred to as similar to that of Konik. The 
detailed description of the manner in which king Konik went to Bhagavan Mahavir 
can be seen in Uvavayee Sutra where the description is detailed and interesting. It 
touches the very heart. The description of Jamali Kumar is in Bhagavati Sutra, 
Shatak 9, Uddeshak 33 and the pomp and show with which Dhanya Kumar left his 
house is similar to that of prince Jamali. The detailed description of Mahabal Kumar 
is in Bhagavati Sutra, Shatak 11, Uddeshak 11. The initiation of Thavachchaputra is 
mentioned in chapter 5 of Jnata Sutra. This description is interesting, so it is 
reproduced here. The account of marriage celebration and the journey for initiation is 
mentioned at Antakrid-dasha Mahima also. Readers can see it from there. 
Meaning- Thereafter, on very day when ascetic Dhanya accepted initiation, 
he came to Bhagavan Mahavir, bowed to him in respect and said—""Bhante!  With 
your permission, I want to observe twoday's fast regularly till my last breath and on 
the day ofbreaking the fast, I want to do Ayambil. Thus, I want to uplift my soul with 
such austerities. 
At the time of conclusion of each two day fast, it shall be my vow to observe 
Ayambil that day and not otherwise. And that too with a resolve to accept food only 
from hands be smeared with food (Sansrisht hands) and not otherwise,to accept 
food that has lost its taste (Ujjhit food) and not otherwise, to accept food that has 
been refused by many monks of other faith (Ajivik etc.), Brahmins, guests,destitute 
and even by beggars."" 
Then, Bhagavan Mahavir said ""0 the blessed! You may do as you wish but 
don't delay it.""

*****  
Commentary: -- Explanation of certain words-- 
Chhattha Tap-- It means to take food only once in the day before the day of 
fast and to avoid food second time (observing Ekashana), to observe complete fast on 
second and third day, i.e., to miss both the meals in these two days and on 
completing the two day's fast to take food only once on the following day. Thus, in all 
food of six times (one of the day before fast, two each of the two days of fast and one of the 
following day) is avoided. Similarly when food is avoided continuously on eight times 
for meals, it is Attham Bhakt, i.e., three day fast. In Upavas or one day fast food for 
four occasions of taking meals (one of the day preceding, two of the day of fasting and one of 
the following day) is avoided. 
The above description about the manner in which fasting was done indicates 
that in those days, the practice of Dharana (eating rich food on the evening before the fasting 
day) and Parana (breaking fast with special preparations on the morning following the fasting day) 
were not prevailent. 
Ayambil-- It is made of two words Ayam and Aamla. Ayam means maand 
(thick liquid). Aamla means sour. When food is prepared by adding these two things, 
that is known as Ayambil or Achamamla. According to this explanation rice, urad (a 
type of pulse) and sattu (wheat or barley flour)—these three foodstuffs can be used in 
Ayambil. The word Aamla (sour) indicates that probably in ancient times, whey was 
taken in Ayambil. But Ayambil is important in controlling urge for taste. Sometimes 
Ayambil is considered more important than even a fast.  
Sansrisht and Uijhit-dharmik—These two words are very important from the 
point of view of tasteless food. When a householder is taking his food, his hand is 
besmeared with the cooked, pulse, vegetable, rice and other liquid or juicy food. In 
case a monk happens to come there at that time, if the householder offers food with 
those hands, it is called Sansrisht food. Ascetic Dhanya had undertaken to accept 
only Sansrisht food. 
Ujjhit-dharmik-- A food or drink that has become tasteless to such an extent 
that no one likes to accept it and is only worthy of being thrown in the dust-bin is 
called Ujjhit-dharmik. Ascetic Dhanya had undertaken to accept such food. This most 
difficult restraint indicates that Dhanya Anagar (Ascetic) had completely detached 
himself from the care for his body and for the taste, so as to conquer sense of taste. 
 
Meaning- After getting permission from Bhagavan Mahavir, Dhanya Anagar 
became happy and satisfied and observed continuously two day fast through out his 
life, thus purifying his soul with the hard austerity. 
He, on the day immediately following his first two day fast, did Svadhyay (study 
of scriptures or study of self).He took permission of Bhagavan Mahavir to break his fastas 
Gautam Swami did. Thereafter he went towardsKakandi. He went to high, low and 
medium families for bhiksha (seeking food in prescribed manner) and accepted food 
according to his vow and proper for Ayambil. He never desired to have tasty food. 
Later, while moving in search of food following EshanaSamiti (the code of 
accepting food), with highest sense ofdiscernment, according to manner prescribed in 
scriptures,offered by the owner and allowed by the teacher, he sometimes got food 
and not water and at others he got only water and not food.

****** 
Even then he showed no signs of helplessness; he was happy and devoid of 
pain, sadness,.fatigue. He always remained in a state of equanimity. Observing 
discrimination required in ascetic order he had accepted and making efforts in still 
higher state of ascetic conduct he had not yet achieved, he followed pure and 
stainless conduct.He accepted in Bhiksha the food that was available and conformed 
to the restraints and left Kakandi with that food.He came to Bhagavan Mahavir and 
showed him what hehad got following the code practised by Gautam Swami. 
Thereafter he, after getting the permission of Bhagavan Mahavir, took that 
food in a detached manner without having any feeling of like or dislike in a state of 
complete equanimity. He put the morsel of food in his mouth and passed it down 
throughing his throat in the same manner as a snake does without touch the two 
sides while going into ahole and just follows the central path. He took meals without 
any attachment for taste. After taking food, he again engaged himself in restraints. 
Commentary: -- In this Sutra, the firm determination (vow) of Dhanya Anagar 
and his great care in following it in letter and spirit has been mentioned. When he 
went for Bhiksha after accepting his vow (restraint), he went to high, medium and low 
families for food and water. He accepted food only from that house where it was 
suitable for Ayambil and where it was fit to be discarded by others. He went in a 
courageous manner after seeking permission of the Guru. In Bhiksha sometimes he 
got only food and no water and sometime only water but no food. However, he never 
showed any signs of helplessness, disgust, anger, meanness or sadness. But 
always remaining in a state of equanimity, increasing his efforts in the accepted code 
and seriously trying to gain still higher code of conduct, he accepted whatever he got 
in Bhiksha provided it was according to the restraints he had undertaken. 
He took the tasteless food worthy to be thrown in a detached manner just as a 
snake enters his place of stay. He was never looking for the taste of meals but his 
only consideration was to look after his body to the extent he was able to continue 
the ascetic practices. This conduct of ignoring taste refers to the words 'Bill-miv 
Pannag bhootenam'—which mean as under—Just as a snake enters the hole 
straight without touching the sides of the hole, he devoured the morsel of tasteless 
and dry food without any feeling of attachment for its taste. 
Meaning- Thereafter one day Bhagavan Mahavir left Sahasraamra-Van 
garden of Kakandi in order to move in other areas.Then Dhanya Anagar learnt 
Samayik (practice forattaining state of equanimity) and eleven Anga Sutra fromthe learned 
monks in the order of Mahavir. He then moved purifying his self with restraint and 
austerities.That Dhanya Anagar was looking bright like a fire to which ghee is added 
from time to time as had been in case of Skandak. This was all due to his hard 
austerities. 
Commentary: -- In the present Sutra, it is mentioned that Dhanya Anagar 
studied eleven Anga Sutras after starting the austerities (tap). In other Sutras, it is 
mentioned that the ascetic first studied the scriptures and then started practicing 
austerities (tap). This fact indicates that Dhanya Anagar started hard austerities 
immediately after his initiation and it was during his austerities that he studied 
Samayik and eleven Anga Sutras from the learned monks (Sthavirs). 
In Agams, Sthavirs are of three categories—

Vaya Sthavir- (Old in age) an ascetic who is of sixty years of age or more. 
Prayry Sthavir- (Senior on the basis of period of initiation) it is that monk whose 
period of initiation is twenty years or more. 
Shrut Sthavir- (Accomplished and learned in view of his scriptural knowledge) they are 
those monks who have studied Sthanang and other Agams. 
Meaning- The state of feet of Dhanya Anagar was as under—The skin of his 
feet was like dry bark of a tree. His feet were likewooden slippers (Khadaon) or an 
old shoe. His feet had dryskin. Their flesh had dried up. They were recognised only 
bybones, skin and nerves. As the flesh and blood had reduced tothe barest 
minimum, the feet could not be recognised by these. 
The toes of Dhanya Anagar were like dried beans ofpeas, pulses or moong, 
urad—such beans that have dried upin the sun and have lost their lustre. Their flesh 
and blood had almost finished. Only bones, skin and nerves werevisible in them. 
The shins of Dhanya Anagar had grown weak due to austerities and looked 
like those of a crow, kank (a bird),dhenik (a carnivorous bird living in water), a she-
peacock, a grasshopper or like the stalk of kak-janghe vegetable.His thighs and 
shins had also dried up and contained only bones, skin and nerves. Their flesh and 
blood had almostdried up. 
Due to austerities, the knees of Dhanya An,agar werelooking like joints of Kali 
(a vegetable), the joints of the feetof a peacock, the joints of Dhenik bird. His knees 
had alsodried up and only bones, skin and nerves were presentThe blood and flesh 
had almost dried up. 
. Due to hard austerities the thighs of Dhanya Anagaar were looking like cut 
and dried soft petals of berry and Shalmali tree. They were dried and had lost their 
lustre.The flesh and blood in them was the barest minimum—almost nil. 
Due to austerities, the waist of Dhanya Anagar waslooking like foot of a 
camel, an old bullock or an old he buffalo. It had flesh and blood to the barest 
minimum. Onlybones, skin and nerves were left. 
Due to hard austerities, the belly of Dhanya Anagar was looking like a dry 
mashak (leather bag used to bill water and carry at the back), and the flat plate used to parch 
grams, the vessel used to knead flour. The stomach of Dhanya Anagar haddried up, 
it had gone empty from within and so was sticking inside. The flesh and blood in it 
had almost finished. 
Due to difficult austerities, the ribs of Dhanya Anagar were looking like a row 
of mirrors placed on eachother on a sloping land. They were like a line of packs of 
beatle containers (panavali). They were like a line of special type of pegs (mundawali). 
Just as the above things could be counted easily, the ribs of Dhanya Anagar could 
also be counted. The blood and flesh in them had dried up and they had reduced to 
a structure of bones alone covered with skin. Nerves were shining in it. 
Due to hard austerities the upper part of back-bone of Dhanya Anagar was 
looking like the edge of crowns. It was looking like a line of round stones stuck to 
each other or round toys of lacquer. The flesh and blood in the back-bonehad almost 
dried up. The round rings of the bones were clearly stuck among themselves under a 
net of nerves and  they simply had a covering of the skin.

***** 
Due to hard austerities, the chest of Dhanya Anagar was looking like lower 
part of a bamboo-basket, a fan made of bamboo sticks or leaves of pine tree. His 
chest had become thin, its flesh and blood had dried up and only bones, skin and 
nerves were left. 
Due to hard austerities the arms (the lower part of shoulders) were looking 
like dried long beams of Khejari tree, long beans hanging from Amaltas tree, long 
beans of Agastik (Agatiya) tree. The arms of Dhanya Anagar had dried up and their 
flesh and blood had almost gone. They had become so thin that only bones, skin and 
nerves were visible. 
Due to hard austerities, the hands of Dhanya Anaagar were looking like dry 
leaves of Banyan tree or of Palash tree. His hands had dried up. They had almost 
lost entire flesh and blood. They appeared like bones and nerves covered with skin. 
Due to hard austerities, the fingers of Dhanya Anaagar were looking like dry 
beans of peas, pulses (moong, urad).Just as soft beans get dried after they are cut 
and placed inthe sun, they lose their brightness, they shrink. The fingers of Dhanya 
Anaagar had also dried up. They had lost flesh andblood. They were merely bones, 
skin and nerves. 
Due to hard austerities, the neck of Dhanya Anaagar was looking like neck of 
a pitcher of water, neck of small vessel, neck of water container (Surahi) with a long 
narrow opening. The flesh and blood of the neck was almost gone. It was looking 
long and dry. 
Due to hard austerities, the chin of Dhanya Anagarwas looking like a dried up 
gourd, dried up hingota fruit,dried up kernel of a mango. The flesh and blood of the 
chinhad gone and it was looking completely dry. 
Due to hard austerities, the lips of Dhanya Anaagar were looking like dried 
leech, dried gum stick, dried incensestick and long dry stick of lacquer. The blood 
and flesh of lips had gone and they had lost their colour. 
Due to hard austerities, the tongue of Dhanya Anagarwas looking like dried 
leaf of a banyan tree, a palash tree, ateak tree. The tongue had dried up and the 
blood and fleshtherein was almost nil. 
Due to hard austerities, the nose of Dhanya Anagarwas looking like dried skin 
of a mango, aamda or bijaura.When these fruits are cut and the lone pieces of their 
skin are kept in the sun, they dry up and lose their colour. The nose of Dhanya 
Anaagar had also lost flesh and blood and had dried up. 
 Due to hard austerities, the eyes of Dhanya Anaagar were looking like holes 
of wind-pipe, a veena (musical instrument) or a morning star that has lost its lustre. 
The eyes of Dhanya were without flesh and blood; they had gone deep inside and 
they had lost their brightness. Only slight shine in the lens of the eye was visible. 
Due to hard austerities, the ears of Dhanya Anaagar were looking like thin 
long skin of a slice of radish, cucumber or karela. His ears had dried up and flesh 
and blood in them was the barest minimum. 
The head of Dhanya Anagar, due to hard austerities, was looking like a dry 
gourd or a dried water-melon. Just asthese soft fruits when cut and dried in the sun,

****                                                                                                                                      
lose their shine, the flesh and blood of head and forehead of Dhanya Anagar had 
also dried up. Only bones, skin and nerves were visible. 
This is the general description of various parts of the body of Dhanya Anagar 
and their ultimate condition due to hard austerities. The only difference is that there 
is no mention of bones in case of stomach, ears, tongue and lips.They had only skin 
and nerves. 
Due to hard austerities, all the parts of the body of Dhanya Anagar had dried 
up and lost flesh and blood. The feet had gone feeble and dry due to starvation, the 
thigh, shins, etc., had gone extremely thin and weak. The waist was like a shallow 
vessel and wrinkled like the back of a tortoise. The bones in it were visible. The 
stomach had stuck to the back due to loss of flesh and blood. The ribs in it were 
distinctly visible. As the blood and flesh of the back-bonehad dried up, its joints were 
looking like beads of arudraksh rosary and could be easily counted. The chest was 
looking like waves of Ganga River. The arms were like a dried up snake-skin that 
has lost flesh and has elongated.His wrist was shivering like leather band of a 
horse.His neck was trembling like a patient suffering from Parkinson's disease. His 
face was lustreless. As both the lips had dried up, the face looked like a pitcher with 
broken mouth. His eyes had sunken. Due to hard and deep austerities his body had 
become so weak, that there was no strength in it. He was moving, sitting and 
standing only with the courage in his self. When he spoke sometimes, he soon got 
tired. He used to feel fatigue while foeaking.He used to feel tired even at the very 
thought that he shallutter something. While walking, his bones rattled as if atruck 
was carrying charcoal. 
The condition of Dhanya Anagar was similar to that of Skandak Anagar. He 
was shining with inner Iiistre of the soul like fire covered with dust. Dhanya Anagar 
was firm in his spiritual practices due to the brightness caused by austerities and the 
aura thereof. He could not be dwindledor shaken in his practices. 
[11] Meaning- At that time during that period there was a town named 
Rajagriha. There was Gunsheelak Chaitya. King Shrenik was the ruler of Rajagriha. 
Once Bhagavan Mahavir came to Rajagriha. People cameto have his darshan 
and to listen his discourse. King Shrenik also came there. After the spiritual 
discourse, the congregation dispersed. 
After listening to the spiritual discourse, meditating on it, king Shrenik turned 
to Bhagavan Mahavir and respectfully inquired--""Bhante! Out of your 14000 monks 
headedby Indrabhuti, who is the one practicing most difficultausterities? Who is the 
one shedding Karmas rapidly?” Bhagavan Mahavir said—""Shrenik! Of my fourteen 
thousand monks—Indrabhuti and others, Dhanya Anagar ispracticing most difficult 
austerities. He is shedding the Karmas most rapidly.""' 
Shrenik again inquired—""Bhante! On what basis your honour has said that out 
of Indrabhuti and other monks totalling fourteen thousands, Dhanya Anagar is 
practicing most difficult austerities and shedding Karmas at great speed?” 
Then Bhagavan Mahavir said—""Shrenik! At that time during that period, there 
was a town named Kakandi.It was prosperous in trade and business-, inhabited by 
well to-do people. Dhanya Kumar was enjoying worldly pleasures in grand palaces.

***** 
Once during my wanderings from one village to the other delivering discourse 
for spiritual uplift, I came to Kakandi and requested for Sahasrasmra-Van garden for 
the stay.I was staying there firm in restraint and austerity. After hearing about my 
arrival, people came to listen to the spiritual discourse. Dhanya Kumar also came 
there. He listened to the spiritual discourse and then got initiated inascetism. 
Thereafter, he was taking food in a state of complete detachment. He started difficult 
and austere-spiritual restraints and practices."" Bhagavan Mahavir then mentioned 
the state of each part of his body—from foot to head due to austerities (as narrated 
earlier). Mahavir further said—He is shining with an aura as a result of his hard 
austerities. 
Therefore, I say, that out of all fourteen thousand monks including Indrabhuti 
he is practicing the most difficult austerities and shedding Karmas at great speed."" 
After hearing this detailed account from Bhagavan Mahavir, king Shrenik, 
thought over it, bowed to Lord three times in the prescribed manner. There after, he 
came to Dhanya Anagar. He bowed to him in respect, went round him. He then said- 
""0 blessed of gods! You deserve appreciation. You are lucky. You are praise-
worthy. You have successfully passedvthis life—the human state."" Thereafter, he 
again bowed to Dhanya Anagar and then came to Bhagavan Mahavir. He bowed to 
Bhagavan Mahavir and went back to the placefrom where he had come. 
[12] Meaning- Later, one day at mid-night Dhanya Anagar thought during 
spiritual awakening— 
`My physical body has become extremely weak due to long and serious 
austerites.' Dhanya Anagar thought the same as Skandak had done. He then took 
the permission of Bhagavan Mahavir and climbed vipulgiri hill with other monks. He 
then carefully selected a suitable place,- bservedit with great discrimination and 
remained in Samlekhana for one month. After remaining in initiated state for just nine 
months, he completed his life-span and crossing over the moon, the sun, and nine 
Graveyaks, was re-born in Sarvarth Siddh Viman as an angel. 
After the death of Dhanya Muni, the monks accompanying him climbed down 
Vipulgiri hill. They came to Bhagavan Mahavir and said—""Bhante! Here are the 
spiritual belongings of Dhanya Anagar."" Then GautamSwami inquired of Bhagavan 
Mahavir—""Bhante! Where has your disciple Dhanya Anagar's soul been re-
born?”Mahavir replied ""He has taken re-birth in SarvarthSiddh Viman."" 
Gautam said—""Bhante! What is the life-span ofangel Dhanya there?” 
Mahavir replied ""Gautam! His life-span is thirty threeSagaropam."" 
Gautam inquired—""Bhante! After completing his angelic life-span, where shall 
he be re-born?” 
Mahavir replied—""O Gautam! He shall take humanbirth in Mahavideh and 
attain liberation from there."" 
Sudharma Swami said ""Jambu! This is the meaning of the first chapter of the 
third Varg as narrated by Bhagavan Mahavir."" 
Commentary: -- Here the final spiritual practice-- the spiritual awakening and 
Samlekhana Santhara has been stated to be similar to that observed by Skandak.  
 
 Dhanya Anagar discarded food for sixty Bhaktas. Here the question arises as

[18] 
 
  Aagam – 09 – Anuttaropapaatik                         Compiled by - Deepratnasagar 
 
to what is Bhakt. In a day there are two times when meals are taken. These are 
called Bhakt. Thus in a month there are sixty Bhaktas. 
When the accompanying monks noticed that Dhanya Anagar has breathed his 
last, they did meditation in the context of his death, the silent meditation done at the 
time of the death of a person is called Parinirvana—pratyayik kayotsarg. To leave 
attachment or care for the corpse of a monk is also called parinirvana. They then 
picked up his pots and clothes, broom etc. They came straight to Bhagavan Mahavir 
and narrated the entire event up to his death in a state of equanimity. They narrated 
his good qualities. 
In this aphorism, it is mentioned that after re-birth in heaven, the soul of 
Dhanya is named as Dhanya Dev. It is said that no new name is given to the souls 
that after life-span in human state or animal state are re-born in heaven. They are 
known by their very name in the preceding life.  
The life-span of angels living in Anuttar Viman is discussed in Anuyoga-dvar 
Sutra. It is mentioned that the minimum life-span of angels in four Anuttar Vimans—
Vijay, Vijayant, Jayant and Aparajit, is thirty one Sagaropam and the maximum is 
thirty three Sagaropam. In Sarvarth Siddh Viman it is thirty three Sagaropam—
neither more nor less. 
The words Palyopam and Sagaropam denote periods of innumerable years. 
In Jain scriptures these words have been used quite often. 
To explain the life-span in hellish existence and angelic existence the words 
Palyopam and Sagaropam have been used.In order to understand the life-span of 
thirty three Sagaropamin the present case, it is pertinent to know Palyopam. It is 
explained in brief as under— 
Palya or palla is a well, or a big silo to store food-grains. Counting of time by 
using palya as a unit is called palyopam. 
Palyopam is of three types—(1) Uddhar Palyopam, (2) Addha Palyopam, and 
(3) Kshetra Palyopam. 
Uddhar Palyopam—the first is defined as—consider a palya (well) which is 
one yojan (4 Kos or eight miles) long, one yojan wide and one yojan deep. It should be 
filled with the extremely small pieces of hair of a newborn Yaugalik baby (child of the 
era of twins) of not more than seven days. The filling should be so packed that the fire 
or water are unable to damage it and even a few pieces do not go astray even if the 
large army of a chakravarti passes over it. If a piece of hair is taken out every samay 
(a very subtle unit of time that can not be divided further), the period taken to make the well 
empty is known as Uddhar palyopam (uddhar means to take out). 
Uddhar Palyopam is of two types—Subtle Uddhar Palyopam and Practical 
(Vyavaharik) Uddhar Palyopam.  Above description is of Practical Uddhar Palyopam. 
Subtle Uddhar Palyopam is explained as under—The pieces of hair that were done 
in case of Practical Uddhar Palyopam be further divided into innumerable pieces that 
are almost invisible. The well should be filled with these subtle pieces as before and 
well packed as mentioned earlier. Thereafter after each samay, one piece is taken 
out. The total time taken to make it empty is known as Subtle Uddhar Palyopam. 
Addha Palyopam—Addha is a native word meaning time. The Palyopam 
mentioned in scriptures in the present case relates to this Palyopam. To understand                        
AnuttaropapaatikDasha- Ang-09  - varga-3, Chapter- 1 
 
 
 
 
 
[19] 
 
  Aagam – 09 – Anuttaropapaatik                         Compiled by - Deepratnasagar 
 
the period, take out one piece after every hundred years. The total time taken to 
make the well empty is Addha Palyopam. It is numerable million years. 
Addha Palyopam is also of two types—Vyavaharik (Practical) and Sukshma 
(subtle). Practical has already been described. The Subtle one is like that in case of 
Uddhar Palyopam. The hair are split into innumerable pieces and taken one each 
hundred years. 
Kshetra Palyopam—When the well or the warehouse for storage of paddy is 
filled with pieces of hair of the children of Yaugalik as mentioned earlier, some 
space-points (Akash Pradesh) remain in-between the pieces of hair although they have 
been fully packed. The space-points in-between may be very small but they are 
visible (roopee) in shape. Space is not roopee. A gross look may not indicate space-
points in-between. But when we think in a subtle and deep manner, we understand 
that the absence of space-points in-between is not true. It can be easily understood 
by an example—Imagine that a large warehouse has been filled with Kushmaands 
(grains). Out wardly it appears full and there is no vacant space. But if lemons are 
stocked, they can also be filled in that warehouse already full of grains. After adding 
lemon-stock, if it is filled with Sarson seeds, we find that sufficient quantity of Sarson 
seeds can also be stocked in the already full warehouse containing Kushmaand and 
lemon. If it is now filled with fine sand at the bed of the stream, we find this can also 
be added. This indicates presence of space-points in-between. 
Second example relates to the wall. Outwardly wall has no vacant space. But 
pegs, nails can be fixed in it. In case there had been no vacant space-points, it would 
not have been possible to fix such things. There are vacant space-points in the wall 
but they are not grossly visible. 
In the discussion relating to Kshetra Palyopam, the space-points in-between 
the pieces of hair of vaugalik babies can be imagined in the light of the above 
examples—In case the space-points touching the hair pieces are taken out one 
every moment (samay), the period taken to take out all vacant space-point is called 
Kshetra Palyopam. This period is, in fact, equal to innumerable Utsarpini-Avasarpini 
period. 
Kshetra Palyopam is of two types—Practical (Vyavharik) andSubtle (Sukshma) 
Kshetra Palyopam. Subtle Kshetra Palyopam can be understood as under—if all the 
space-points touching and not touching the hair-pieces are taken out one each at 
every moment (samay), the total time taken to vacate the well is Subtle Kshetra 
Palyopam. Its time period is also equal to innumerable Utsarpini-Avasarpini time 
period. Its time period is innumerable time more than Practical Kshetra Palyopam. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
[12] Meaning- Jambu Swami said to Sudharma Swami—""Bhante! I have 
grasped the meaning of the first chapter of third Vargof Anuttaraupapatik Sutra. 
Please tell me the meaning ofthe second chapter as narrated by Bhagavan Mahavir.""

Sudharma Swami replied ""Jambu! At that time during that, period, there was a 
town named Kakandi.Jitshatru was its ruler. Bhadra Sarthvahi was residing there. 
She was well-to-do and prosperous. She had a son called Sunakshatra. He was 
well-built and very handsome. When he attained youth, he was married to thirty two 
young girls like Dhanya Kumar. The description of gifts from their parents to the girls 
may be understood as similar to those of Dhanya Kumar's wives. He started enjoying 
worldly pleasures in the palatial buildings like DhanyaKumar. He had been brought 
up by five nurses. 
At  that time, during that period, once Bhagavan Mahavir came to Kakandi. 
Like Dhanya Kumar, Sunakshatra Kumar went to have his darshan. He heard the 
spiritual discourse and decided to get initiated. Further description is the same as 
that of Thavachchaputra.He strictly followed Iriya Samiti (the restraints and precautions to 
be observed in movements) and becamebrahmachari (perfectly celibate). 
Like Dhanya Anagar, Sunakshatra Anagar decided on the very day of his 
initiation to do two day fasts in continuation and to complete each such fast with 
Ayambil accepting food and water only if it is according to his abhigrah (special 
resolve). He used to take meals in adetached manner. He was extremely careful in 
observing his vows and restraints and being firm in them while going outin populated 
areas. He studied eleven Anga Sutras. He was moving out completely following the 
restraints and austerities and thus elevating his soul. Due to observance of 
austerities for a long period, he became extremely weak like Skandak Anagar. 
At that time, during that period there was a town called Rajagriha. 
At that time during that period there was a city called Rajagriha. There was 
Gunsheelak Chaitya. King Shrenik was ruler. Once Bhagavan Mahavir came their. 
People came to have his darshan. The king also came there. Spiritual discourse was 
made by Bhagavan Mahavir.Thereafter the king returned. The congregation also 
dispersed. 
Later, once during the fourth quarter of night,Sunakshatra Anagar thought like 
Skandak and adopted same course as was done by Skandak (He climbed up Vipulgiri 
with other monks like Dhanya Anagar asmentioned in first chapter.) He observed ascetic 
conduct formany years. Further account is similar to that of Dhanya Anagar including 
inquiry of Gautam from Mahavir abouthis life. He was also re-born in Sarvarth Siddh 
Viman as anangel where his life-span is 33 Sagaropam.Gautam inquired—""Bhante! 
After the angelic life-span, where shall Sunakshatra Dev be re-born?"" Bhagavan 
Mahavir said- ""He shall take birth in Mahavideh and attain salvation from there."" 
The description of the remaining eight young men is similar to that of 
Sunakshatra Anagar. The only difference isthat the first two belonged to Rajagriha, 
the next two to Saket, the later two to Vanijyagram, the ninth one to Hastinapur and 
the last one, i.e., the tenth one to Rajagriha. Mother of the first nine was Bhadra. 
They were married to thirty two young girls each and their gifts in marriage from their 
parents were same as in case of Dhanya Kumar. They got initiated like 
Thavachchaputra. The initiation ceremony of Vihalla Kumar was performed by his 
father. The span of ascetic life of Vihalla was six months, that of DhanyaKumar was 
nine months and of the remaining eight was many years. Each one of them observed 
Samlekhana for one month. All of them were re-born in Sarvarth Siddh heaven.

All of them shall re-incarnate in Mahavideh and attain salvation from there. 
Thus, all the chapters have been concluded. 
Arya Sudharmas said ""Jambu Bhagavan Mahavir was fountain head of 
religion. He was founder of the religious order. He was self-enlightened. He was 
master of the world, glitter of the world, be acon light of the world. He was erasor 
offears. He was giver of shelter. He was opener of the vision forgaining knowledge. 
He was giver of the spiritual path. He was giver of spirituality, the Dharma. He was 
master of spirituality. He was the terminator of wandering in four states of existence 
by his ideal spiritual conduct. He was the king emperor in the domain of spirituality. 
He possessed undefiable knowledge and firm and clear perception. He was 
conqueror offeelings of attachment and aversion. He was helping others in 
overcoming completely the currents of attachment and aversion. He had gained 
knowledge by his personal efforts and was giver of high spiritual knowledge to 
others. He had liberated himself (from the chain of birth and death, the wandering in 
the worldly ocean) and was guiding others to obtain that state of liberation. He had 
crossed the worldly ocean and was guiding others to cross it successfully. He had 
reached the place free from disturbances, free from diseases,free from obstacles, 
free from falling into worldly existence. 
That place is a fixed one. It can never be eliminated. It is called Siddh state—
the state of complete liberation. Bhagavan Mahavir, who is possessor of all the 
above qualities and who has now reached the final state of liberation, had narrated 
the third Varg of Anuttaropapatik-dasha Sutra in this way. 
Anuttaropapatik-dasha Sutra has one Shrutskandh, three Vargs and it is 
recited in three days. It is taught in three days. There are ten Uddeshaks in the first 
Varg, thirteen Uddeshaks in second Varg and ten Uddeshaks in the third Varg.

◙ Something about This Publication ◙ 
 
We have already published 45 Aagams in Four languages Prakrut, Sanskrut 
(Satik), Hindi and Gujarati.  Now a day for new generation & abroad living people, 
English translation has become a necessity.  So we have planned to translate or 
compile Jain-Aagam in English. We gave priority to ‘Nandi Sootra’, after that we 
have worked for ‘Niryaavalika panchak’. Thus six Aagam have been completed. 
 
During the Translation-work of “Nirayaavalika-panchak” one thing came 
before me, all the character of these stories have either gone in hell or in heaven. 
To get rebirth in hell or heaven is a result of their own good or bad deeds. By good 
deeds people achieves hqppiness-[SUKH] and by bad deeds people achieves 
miseries-[Dukh]. The descriptions contain Dukh-Vipaak or Sukh-Vipaak in which 
Canonical literature is an Ang Aagam-Sootra named “VIPAK-SHRUT. 
Vipak-Shrut is an “Ang-Pavitth” Aagam, NandiSootra, SuyagadangSootra 
etc. Narrates ‘Vipak sootra’ as an eleventh Ang-Sootra of Aagam. AbhaydevSuri 
has written Vrutti [commentary] on this sootr. 
Here, we have compiled Translation done by Surendra Bothara, which is 
originally edited in to Hindi by Shree Am ar-Muni & Shree Chandra Surana, We 
have  two motives for publishing this book.—[1] To provide Aagam literature in 
English & [2] It should be given in Microsoft Word format so people can do Cut, 
Paste & Editing by themselves also. 
At present this Book is published as a Net-Publication with the help of the 
Jain Education International organization of America.  In future we may publish it as 
a Book also. We are also planning to put more Aagams in English before you. 
We also invite learned persons to translate more & more ‘authentic Jain 
literature in English for kids and youths, so the ignorant-people of regional 
languages can also read or learn our “Shashtra & Granth”. 
 
We are very much thankful to Shree Pravinbhai, Sudeshbhai, Late Mr. Krupal 
Shah and all other known-unknown persons who helpd us for this project directly or 
indirectly.

Introduction:- 
This eleventh Anga (The primary can ons or the main corpus of the Jain canonical texts. 
This consists of twelve treatises, eleven of which are extant according to the Shvetambar tradition.) 
is popularly known as Vipaak Shrut. Vipaak means the fruits of the good and bad karmas 
acquired by a soul. The scripture where these are described is called Vipaak Shrut. It has 
two Shrutskandhs (parts). The first Shrutskandh describes the bitter fruits of bad karmas. 
Accordingly it is popularly known as Duhkha-vipaak (fruits of bad or ignoble karmas). 
As the second Shrutskandh describes the fruits of good or noble karmas it is known as 
Sukha-vipaak. Each of these parts contains ten chapters. The first chapter of the first part is 
titled Mrigaputra. This is an elaborate chapter and all the following chapters are brief. 
The first chapter contains the story of the son of Vijaya Kshatriya and Mrigarani of 
Mrigagram. This story is so heart-rending that mere reading or listening to it makes one 
shiver. Thinking about the consequences of violence and other bad and cruel deeds makes 
one detest and abhor sinful activity. What to say of an ordinary human being when a great 
sage like Gautam - Swami was touched by horrible and pathetic condition of Mrugaputra. 
Man loves pleasure and detests pain. Whether he gets pleasure or not, he 
certainly does not desire pain. Therefore, his first priority is to be rid of pain. Based on 
this psychological fact, this scripture initially throws light on sorrow and its root causes in 
a lucid style in its first part, Duhkha-vipaak. 
--►SHRUTSKANDH - 1◄-- 
 
 
[1] Meaning - During that period (end of the fourth section of the current descending 
cycle of time) of time (when Arya Sudharma was narrating this text) there was a city called 
Champa. Description of Champa city should be read as in Aupapatik Sutra. (Outside the 
city, in the north-eastern direction) their was a Purnabhadra Chaitya Description of Purna-
bhadra Chaitya should also be read as in Aupapatik Sutra. 
During that period of time Arya Sudharma, a disciple of Shraman Bhagavan Mahavir, 
was living. He belonged to a prominent family and caste (born of an able and virtuous mother). 
Besides being strong, handsome, and humble he was also endowed with loftiest of virtues. 
He had the complete knowledge of all the fourteen Purvas (subtle canon) and possessed all 
the four branches of knowledge, namely mati, shrut, avadhi and manahparyav jnana (sensory 
knowledge, scriptural knowledge, extrasensory perception of the physical dimension, and 
extrasensory perception and knowledge of thought process and thought-forms of other beings). 
Wandering from one village to another, along with his five hundred disciples, Sudharma 
Swami arrived at the Purnabhadra Chaitya in the town of Champa. After seeking formal 
permission he camped there. Throngs of people came to attend his discourse. Sudharma 
Swami gave a discourse and then the masses returned home.

During that period of time Arya Jambu was the senior most among the disciples 
of Arya Sudharma Swami. He was seven cubits tall (in Utsedhangul units or standard of 
fragmentary units of angel or breadth of finger; for details refer to Anuyogadvar), very 
handsome and radiant. The description of his virtues should be read as those of 
Sudharma Swami mentioned in Jnata Dharma Kathanga. 
He was sitting near and absorbed in worship of Arya Sudharma Swami. At that time a 
curiosity sparked in his mind. He got up and approached Sudharma Swami. He circum-
ambulated Sudharma Swami three times clockwise, and bowed before him. He sat down 
neither very far nor very near Sudharma Swami and humbly and respectfully spoke- 
[2] Meaning - ""Bhante! If this is the text and meaning of the tenth Anga named 
PrashnaVyakaran as given by Shraman Bhagavan Mahavir, who has attained Siddha-
state, what is text and meaning of eleventh Anga, VipaakShrut, as given by him?” 
Sudharma Swami said to ascetic Jambu—""O Jambu! Shraman Bhagavan Mahavir, who 
has attained liberation, has preached the eleventh Anga in two parts—(1) Duhkha-vipaak 
(fruits of bad or ignoble karmas) and (2) Sukha-vipaak (fruits of good or noble karmas). 
Jambu- ""Bhante! When Shraman Bhagavan Mahavir, who has attained liberation, 
has preached the eleventh Anga in two parts, Duhkha-vipaak and Sukha-vipaak, then 
according to him how many chapters are there in the first part titled Duhkha-vipaak?” 
""Jambu ! Shraman Bhagavan Mahavir, who is the first propagates of dharma 
(Aaigare or Aadikar), the religious ford-maker (Titthagare or Tirthankar),... and so on up to... 
who has attained liberation has preached ten chapters of Duhkha-vipaak. They are— 
[3] Meaning- (1) Mrigaputra, (2) Ujjhitak, (3) Abhagnasen, (4) Shakat, (5) Brihas-
pati, (6) Nandivardhan, (7) Umbardatt, (8) Shaurik Datt, (9) Devadatta, and (10) Anju"". 
[4] Meaning- Bhante ! When Shraman Bhagavan Mahavir, the first propagater of 
dharma, the Tirthankar, and who has attained liberation, has preached ten chapters of 
Duhkha-vipaak from Mrigaputra to Anju, then what is the text and meaning of the first 
chapter of Duhkha-vipaak? 
Arya Sudharma replied—Jambu! During that period of time there was a town named 
Mrugagram (the details should be read from the description of city mentioned in Aupapatik Sutra). In 
north-eastern direction (Ishan Kone) outside this towr, was a garden named Chandanapadap 
having trees bearing all season flowers and fruits. In that garden there was an ancient temple 
of Sudharma Yaksh. The details of this should be read from the description of Purnabhadra 
Yaksh temple (Aupapatik Sutra). 
Commentary—in this Agam the word Wannao' has been mainly used in four 
instances—with description of a city, garden, king, and queen. This is a style traditionally 
accepted in Jain Agams that when complete details of some garden, city, king, queen, or 
practicing ascetic have been narrated in one particular Agam, it is not generally repeated 
elsewhere. Instead, using the term Tannao' (varnan or description) it is advised to read the 
description from that specific Agam. Thus wherever Vannao' is mentioned it should taken as 
an indication to read the description of a city, garden, king, and queen from Aupapatik Sutra. 
Like Vannao' the term 'Java' is also used to indicate to read description from some other 
place. In place of Vannao we will use the word description in parenthesis.

***** 
Meaning- In that Mrugagram lived a Kshatriya King named Vijaya (description as 
in Aupapatik Sutra). That Kshatriya King named Vijaya had a queen named Mruga. She 
was perfectly beautiful and had fully developed sense organs (description as in Aupapatik 
Sutra). That Vijaya Kshatriya and Mruga had a son named Mrugaputra. Since his birth 
that child was blind, dumb and deaf, crippled and was with hund-samsthan (crooked-
constitution; a body constitution where almost every part of body is deformed and disfigured). 
He suffered from congenital rheumatism (vaat-roag). That child had no hands, feet, ears 
or nose. He only had mere outlines of these parts and those too for namesake. 
Therefore, that Mruga Devi was feeding and bringing up that child under wraps in 
a secret cellar. 
Commentary—According to Charak Samhita ,there are 80 kinds of diseases 
caused due to disturbed vaat (one of the body humours). Some of these are—stiff back, 
bent neck, and parts of body going numb. Rheumatism and gout are also caused by 
disturbed vaat. These are highly disturbing and chronic ailments. 
 
[5] Meaning- In that Mrugagram city lived a congenital blind. A person with normal 
vision always guided him holding his stick. Only with the help of this person he moved around 
in the city. His hair was shriveled and disheveled. Swarms of houseflies hovered around him 
(so dirty and repulsive was he). That blind person earned his livelihood by humbly and pitifully 
seeking alms door to door in Mrugagram city. 
During that period of time Shraman Bhagavan Mahavir arrived (in Chandanapadap 
garden outside the city). Getting the news of Bhagavan's arrival people came to pay 
homage. Like king Kunik the Kshatriya king Vijaya also came out to pay homage. Going 
to the Samavasaran he commenced Bhagavan's worship. 
At that time the person who was blind by birth listened to the commotion and 
asked his guide—""Beloved of gods! Is their some divine festival or celebration in 
Mrigagram city? Or there is some procession going to a garden or a hill? Why all these 
people are going out of the city in the same direction?” 
That person replied to the blind man—""Beloved of gods! There is nothing like a 
divine festival in city but Shraman Bhagavan Mahavir has arrived in Chandanapadap 
garden outside the city. These people are going there to pay homage."" 
The blind man said to his guide—""Beloved of gods! Come, let us go as well and 
worship Bhagavan."" 
Then the guide holding the stick of the blind man led him to the place where Shraman 
Bhagavan Mahavir was seated. The blind man circumambulated Bhaga van three times and 
paid homage and obeisance. He then commenced Bhagavan's worship. Shraman Bhagavan 
Mahavir gave his discourse to king Vijaya and the people of the city, after which the king and 
the people returned home. 
[6] Meaning- During that period of time Indrabhuti Anagar (Gautam Swami), the chief 
disciple of Shraman Bhagavan Mahavir, was also sitting there. When Bhagavan Gautam 
Swami saw the man who was blind by birth he became curious. He asked—""Bhante! Is 
there some (other) person who is blind by birth (like him), absolutely blind."" 
Bhagavan said—""Yes ! There is such a person.""

Gautam Swami asked—""Where is that person who is blind by birth (like him), 
absolutely blind?” 
Bhagavan said—""Gautam! In this very Mrigagram city child Mrigaputra, the son of 
Vijaya Kshatriya and Mriga, is blind by birth (like him), absolutely blind. He does not even 
have hands and feet and other parts of the body. He only has mere outlines of these parts. 
His mother Mriga Devi feeds and brings up that child carefully and furtively."" 
Bhagavan Gautam then paid homage and obeisance to Bhagavan and 
requested—""Bhante! If you give permission I would like to see that child Mrigaputra."" 
Bhagavan said—""Do as you please, Gautam. 
On getting permission from Shraman Bhagavan Mahavir, Gautam Swami was 
pleased and contented. - He left Bhagavan to go and see Mrigaputra. Observing irya samiti 
(care of movement) he moved without any haste and came to Mrigagram city. He entered the 
city from the main road and came to the house of Mriga Devi. 
When Mruga Devi saw Gautam Swami coming she was pleased and delighted. After 
paying homage and obeisance she asked—""Beloved of gods! What gives me the honour of 
your visit ?"" 
Bhagavan Gautam responded—""Beloved of gods! I have straightway come to 
see your son."" At this Mruga Devi adorned her four sons born after Mrigaputra and 
made them touch Gautam Swami's feet. She said—""Bhante ! Look here please, these 
are my sons."" 
Bhagavan Gautam told Mruga Devi—""Beloved of gods! I have not come here to see 
your these sons but to see your eldest son, Mrugaputra, who is blind by birth, absolutely blind. 
You have kept this son in an isolated cellar and are feeding and bringing him up carefully 
under wraps. I have come here only to see him."" Mruga Devi was taken aback at these 
words. She asked—""O Gautam! Who is that great sage and ascetic that has revealed my 
well kept secret so explicitly and enabled you to be aware of my secret without any effort?” 
Bhagavan Gautam Swami said—""Lady ! It is my religious leader (who is one such 
omniscient) who has told me this secret. 
While Mruga Devi was talking to Bhagavan Gautam Swami thus, it was time to feed 
child Mrugaputra. Mriga Devi said to Gautam Swami—""Bhante ! Please wait here, I will soon 
show you child Mrigaputra."" Having said so she went to the kitchen, changed her dress and 
took a wooden trolley. She placed enough quantity of staple food, liquids, general food, and 
savoury food (ashan, paan, khadya, svadya) in the trolley. Pushing this trolley she came where 
Bhagavan Gautam Swami was waiting and said--Bhante! Please follow me. I will show you 
child Mrigaputra."" Gautam Swami followed Mriga Devi (on being requested). 
Pushing the trolley, Mriga Devi came to the cellar and covered her mouth with a 
peace of cloth folded four times. She requested Bhagavan Gautam Swami—""Bhante! 
Please cover your mouth with a folded piece of cloth."" Bhagavan Gautam Swami 
followed the advise and covered his mouth with a folded piece of cloth. 
Commentary—The purpose of covering mouth, this includes nose as well, with four 
folds of cloth is to minimize the offensive stench pervading that place. It is nose and not mouth 
that is receptor of smell. Mriga Devi had also covered her nose because only that could

minimize the stench. As far as covering only the mouth is concerned, it was an essential part of 
Gautam Swami's code.  
Meaning- Mruga Devi then opened the gate of cellar with her face turned away. 
A whiff of stench came from cellar. This stench was much more obnoxious, repulsive 
and intolerable than that of a dead snake (or a decayed carcass of cow, dog, cat, or rat). 
Attracted and mesmerized by the aroma of the staple food, liquids, general food, 
and savoury food (ashan, paan, khadya, svadya), Mrugaputra swallowed food through his 
mouth. He at once digested that food and it transformed into pus and blood. Mrugaputra 
soon vomited what he ate in the form of pus and blood and licked back the whole thing. 
Looking at this horrible (repulsive and pathetic) condition Bhagavan Gautam Swami 
thoughtfully contemplated—""Oh! This child is suffering the fruits of sin as a consequence of 
the sinful karmas he acquired due to intentionally committed evil deeds (dushchirna) during 
his earlier births, and which are not easily destroyed (dushpratikrant). I have not seen hell or 
infernal beings in person but here I can see that this Mrigaputra is, indeed, suffering infernal 
miseries."" With these thoughts Bhagavan Gautam Swami said to Mriga Devi—""Now I am 
going."" And he left that house. Crossing Mrugagram city he came where Bhagavan Mahavir 
was seated. After going around Bhagavan and paying him homage and obeisance he said— 
""Bhante! On getting your permission I crossed Mrigagram city and reached the house 
of Mriga Devi, who was pleased to see me coming... and so on up to... When I saw 
Mrigaputra licking pus and blood I thought—Oh! This child leads a miserable life suffering the 
fruits of intense sinful karmas he acquired during his earlier births. 
[7] Meaning- ""Bhante ! Who was this Mrugaputra in his earlier birth? What was 
his name and family ? In which village or city he lived ? He leads this miserable life as a 
consequence of what karmas he acquired, which activities he indulged in, and what 
deeds he committed?” 
Shraman Bhagavan Mahavir said to Bhagavan Gautam—""Gautam! During that 
period of time there was a prosperous city called Shatadvar in Bharatvarsh area in 
Jambu continent. A king named Dhanapati was the ruler of that city. On its south-east 
direction (Agni Kone) was a grand and prosperous khet (a settlement surrounded by a 
temporary mud wall; borough). There were five hundred villages under that borough called 
Vijayavardhaman. In that borough there was a governor (rashtrakoot) named Ekadi 
(Ikkai) who was irreligious and dushprtyanandi (a person who enjoys evil deeds or who is so 
discontented that it is difficult to please him). That governor Ekadi ruled and protected the 
five hundred villages of Vijayavardhaman borough. 
That governor Ekadi loaded the five hundred villages of Vijayavardhaman 
borough with taxes. He would take back twice of whatever grains he gave to farmers. He 
took bribe and tortured the people ruthlessly. He charged excessive interest from them 
and charged them of murder and other crimes. He extorted money from people and 
appointed agents at various places for collecting such funds. He nurtured and protected 
thieves and other rogues. He would set fire to villages, torment and rob travelers. This 
way he continued to exploit and torment people. He had imposed his tortuous rule by 
whipping people, impoverishing them and forcing them to go against religion.

Even after hearing the opinions of people like regional kings (raja), influential and 
rich persons (ishvar), knights of honour (talavar), landlords (mandavik), heads of large 
families (kautumbik), established merchants (shreshti), caravan chiefs (sarthavaha) and 
other villagers during their activities, deliberations, secret consultations, decisions, 
controversies and social interactions, that governor Ekadi would say-4 have not heard.' 
When he had not heard anything he would say--i have heard.' In the same way he 
would say 'I have not seen, not spoken, not accepted, and not understood' for things he 
had seen, spoken, accepted, and understood. Thus indulging in such wicked and cruel 
deeds (eyakamme), considering deceitful activities to be his prime duty (eyappahane), 
gaining expertise in tormenting people (eyavijje), and accepting willful action to be good 
conduct (eyasamayare), that governor Ekadi led an extremely ignoble life acquiring 
highly demeritorious karmas. 
(Note : Using four adjectives like `eyakamme' the aphorism conveys that the governor 
was immersed up to his neck in such extremely wicked activities.) 
After some time that governor Ekadi suffered from sixteen different chronic 
ailments simultaneously. They are-  
[8] Meaning- (1) asthma (shvas), (2) bronchitis (kaas), (3) fever (jvar), (4) burning 
sensation (daaha), (5) stomach ache (kukshi shool), (6) fistula of the anus (bhagandar),   
(7) bleeding piles (arsh or bavasir), (8) indigestion (ajeern), (9) Glaucoma (drishti shoal), 
(10) headache (mastak shool), (11) loss of appetite (bhojan-aruchi), (12) pain in the eyes 
(akshi vedana), (13) pain in the ears (karna vedana), (14) eczema (khujali), (15) dropsy 
(jalodar), and (16) leprosy (kusht roag). 
[9] Meaning- When he suffered from these ailments governor Ekadi called his 
servants and instructed, ""Beloved of gods! Go and make this announcement loudly at 
every corner, crossings where three, four or more roads meet, main road and streets in 
the Vijayavardhaman borough- 
`0 Beloved of gods ! Governor Ekadi is suffering from the pain of sixteen different 
ailments including asthma, bronchitis,... and so on up to... leprosy. Any Vaidya (qualified 
Ayurvedic doctors) and junior Vaidya, or senior and junior Jnayak (those who learned and 
practiced the art of healing through their own experience), or senior and junior Chikitsak 
(those who practiced medicine and surgery) who is able to cure even one of these 
diseases will be amply and richly rewarded by the governor.' Make this announcement two 
or three times and report back to me. 
The servants did as told and reported back.  
Hearing and understanding this announcement in Vijayavardhaman borough many 
healers (etc.) collected their instrument boxes and left their homes. They passed through the 
streets of Vijayavardhaman borough and came to the residence of Governor Ekadi. They 
thoroughly examined and questioned the patient. After diagnosis they selected different 
methods and regimens of treatment and tried to cure just one of the said ailments. The 
methods and processes employed are— 
(1) Abhyangan or application of medicinal pastes, (2) Udvartan or rubbing with 
medicinalpastes,(3) Snehapan or giving medicatedoils,(4) Vaman or emesis,(5) Virechan

ailment. When these healers got exhausted (shraant), confused or mentally tired (tant), 
and disappointed (paritant) they returned from where they came. 
When the dejected healers expressed their inability to treat, the nursing staff also left him 
alone. He got tired and dejected of taking medicines. Tired of the sufferings of the. sixteen 
ailments and in a state ofdeep attachment and craving for kingdom, state, and his harem;  
mentally tormented (artt), physically tortured (duhkhart), and enslaved by sense organs 
(vashart), that governor Ekadi lived this agonizing life for 250 years. He then died and was 
reborn as an infernal being among the infernal beings of the Ratnaprabha Prithvi (the first hell) 
having a maximum life-span of one Sagaropam. 
After completing the life-span as an infernal being, the soul that was Ekadi at 
once took birth as son from the womb of Mriga Devi, the wife of Vijaya Kshatriya. 
When that soul descended into the womb of Mriga Devi her body suffered acute and 
excruciating pain. Since the day child Mrigaputra was conceived she became unpleasant, 
loathsome, detestable, and repugnant to Vijaya Kshatriya (her husband). 
Some days later one midnight when she was awake and worrying about the family, 
Mriga Devi thought—""Earlier I appeared pleasant, beautiful, lovable, adorable highly desirable to 
Vijaya Kshatriya. I was cherished and trusted by him. But since this soul has come in my womb 
as a fetus I have become unpleasant... and so on up to... repugnant to Vijaya Kshatriya. What to 
say of seeing and sharing moments of enjoyment with me when Vijaya Kshatriya does not want 
to hear and remember even my name and family now. Therefore, it would be good for me to get 
rid of this fetus by process of shaatana (to disintegrate and throw out in pieces), paatana (to abort in 
one piece), gaalana (to dissolve and throw out), and maarana (to kill). Thus she decided to get rid of 
the fetus by shaatana... and so on up to... maarana and in order to do so she started taking salty 
or alkaline, bitter and astringent medicines with a desire to be rid of the fetus. But all these efforts 
failed to destroy the fetus. When Mriga Devi failed to get rid of the fetus, she became tired, 
exhausted, disappointed, dejected, and sad. Out of compulsion and in a distressed state of 
mind, she carried the fetus. 
That child in the womb had eight arteries flowing inward and eight veins flowing 
outward. Of these sixteen tubular vessels two pairs each were intermittently emitting pus 
and blood through holes of ears, eyes, nose, and heart. That boy suffered from a disease

called bhasmak (a disease in which food is digested quickly). As a consequence whatever he 
consumed was quickly digested and at once turned into pus and blood. 
After nine months of pregnancy Mruga Devi gave birth to a child who was congenitally 
blind (dumb, deaf, crippled, deformed and disfigured) and had mere outlines of body-parts. The 
moment Mriga Devi saw such deformed, disfigured and blind child she was terrified, horrified, 
disgusted and disturbed. (She started trembling with fear.) She at once called the nursemaid and 
said—""Beloved of gods! Go and throw this infant on a heap of trash in isolation."" 
The nursemaid accepted Mriga Devi's order by uttering—""All right."" After that she 
went to Vijaya Kshatriya and said—""Master! After nine months of pregnancy Mriga Devi gave 
birth to a child who is congenitally blind... and so on up to... and has mere outlines of body-
parts. When Mriga Devi saw this deformed and blind child she was terrified and called me. 
She said to me—`Beloved of gods! Go and throw this infant on a heap of trash in isolation.' 
So, master! Please tell me if I should throw this infant in isolation or not?” 
On hearing all this from the nursemaid Vijaya Kshatriya got disturbed and stood up. 
He then came to Mriga Devi and said—""Beloved of gods! This is your first born and if you 
throw him on a heap of trash in isolation your future offspring will not be firm. In other 
words, they will be harmed. Therefore, (instead of throwing him) you should feed and rear up 
this child under wraps in a secret cellar. This would make your future offspring firm and 
stable."" Mriga Devi humbly accepted Vijaya Kshatriya's advise by uttering—""As you say."" 
And she started feeding and bringing up that child under wraps in a secret cellar. 
Bhagavan Mahavir added—""Gautam ! Thus child Mrugaputra is biding his time 
visibly suffering the fruits of demeritorious karmas he acquired during his earlier birth."" 
[10] Meaning- ""Bhante ! Where will this child Mrigaputra go after his death ? 
Where will he reincarnate?"" (Gautam asked) 
(Replying to Gautam Swami's question Bhagavan Mahavir said-) Gautam! He will die at 
the (ordained) moment of death at the conclusion of his (predestined) life-span of twenty six 
years and will be born as a lion in a pride of lions in the valley of the Vaitadhya Mountain. 
That lion will be extremely impious and, indulging in grave sinful activities, he will 
accumulate excessive bad karmas. After death that lion will take birth as an infernal being 
among the infernal beings of Ratnaprabha Prithvi, the first hell, having a maximum life-span 
of one Sagaropam. From the first hell he will get reborn in the genus of reptiles and from 
there he will reincarnate in second hell having a maximum life span of three Sagaropam. 
Coming out from there after death he will get reborn as a bird and from there in 
the third hell having a maximum life span of seven Sagaropam. 
Ending his life as an infernal being he will get reborn as a lion and from there in the 
fourth hell. After leaving fourth hell he will take rebirth as a snake and from there in the fifth 
hell. After fifth hell he will take birth as a woman and then in the sixth hell. After the sixth hell 
he will take birth as a man and then in the seventh hell. Coming out of the seventh hell he 
will enter the genus of jalachar-panchendriya tiryanch-yonik (aquatic five-sensed animal) 
that includes 1.25 million species including fish, tortoise, crocodile, alligator, and Sunsumar. 
In each different species he will take birth and die millions of times

After this he will take birth and die millions of times in numerous different species 
including—animals such as ur-parisarp (non-limbedreptilian), bhuj-parisarp (limbed 
reptilian), khechar (aerial beings); four, three, and two sensed beings; plant-bodied beings 
such as trees with bitter fruits and milk; and air, fire, water and earth-bodied beings. 
After that he will take birth as a bull in Supratishthapur city. When this bull will mature, 
one day at the beginning of the monsoon season while digging earth on the banks of the 
Ganges the bank will collapse. He will be swept away in the currents of the river and die a 
painful death. He will then reincarnate in the very same Supratishthapur city in the house of a 
merchant as his son. 
On completing his adolescence and attaining youth he will listen to the sermon of 
worthy senior ascetics. He will ponder over it and get initiated as an ascetic after tonsuring 
his head. He will observe the codes of Irya sarniti (care of movement)... and so on up to... he 
will become completely celibate. Leading an ascetic life observing the ascetic codes 
properly he will embrace meditational death after purifying his soul with critical review and 
expiation (pratikrarnan). He will then reincarnate as a god in the first heaven called 
Saudharma Devlok. 
On completing the life-span in the divine realm he will descend and be reborn in 
an affluent family in Mahavideh area. There his education, initiation and other 
information up to getting liberated should be read as in the story of Dridhapratijna. 
Sudharma Swami concluded, ""Jambu! Shraman Bhagavan Mahavir, who has 
attained nirvana, has narrated this text and meaning of the first chapter of Duhkha-vipaak. 
(So I have heard from him and so I state.)"" 
Commentary- Explaining the meanings of the phrases like `unmukka baal bhaavarn' 
Acharyashri writes—baal bhaava means childhood. Vinnaya means one who can differentiate 
between good and bad; sagacious. Jovvanaganupatte means to attain youth. 
In this story yoni, jati and kulakoti words have been used. While interpreting 
these terms Acharya Shri Atmaram ji M. has provided following explanation— 
""Pondering over the terms yoni, jati and kulakoti will be helpful in properly 
understanding the aforesaid statement. This goes as follows— 
Jati—It has many meanings but in this context it means one, two, three, four and five 
sensed beings. The statement under reference is discussing aquatic five sensed beings. 
Therefore, here the term jati specifically means aquatic five sensed beings. 
Kulakoti—a group of beings is called kula (species), and different subgroups of these 
kulas are called koti. The beings having same attributes arebelieved to belong to one hula 
and those having different attributes are believed to belong to different groups. 
In spite of the place of origin or the genus being the same there can be different 
groups (kulas) of beings depending upon their attributes. For a better general under-
standing a good example is cowdung— 
A variety of insects, such as scorpion, worms and other insects, originate from a lump of 
cowdung during the monsoon season. Although the place of origin is same the insects belong 
to different groups (kulas).                                                                                                           
Yoni-   place of origin (genus). A soul carries along it’s taijas and karman shariras

INTRODUCTION:- The second chapter of Duhkha-vipaak is titled `Ujjhitak'. The first 
chapter, Mrugaputra, describes the bitter consequences of tormenting and torturing people 
and indulging in cruel violent deeds. This second chapter contains the story of Ujjhitak 
Kumar describing the grave consequences of sinful deeds like cruel, tortuous, and violent 
treatment of animals; extreme lust and adultery. These stories also reveal that when such 
sinful being is conceived, the mother has equally base and violent dohad (desires of a 
pregnant mother). Such dohad is said to be the indicator of the eventual attitude of the being 
to be born. This chapter has the story of Ujjhitak. 
[11] Meaning- Bhante! When Shraman Bhagavan Mahavir, who has attained 
liberation, has preached the aforesaid text and meaning of the first chapter of Duhkha-vipaak, 
then what is text and meaning of the second chapter of Duhkha-vipaak as preached by him?  
Jambu! During that period of time there was a city named Vanijyagram, which was 
prosperous in all respects. In the northeastern direction (Ishan Kone) outside this town was a 
garden named Dutipalash. In that Dutipalash garden there was a temple of Sudharma Yaksh. 
In that; Vanijyagram city lived King Mitra. That King named Mitra had a queen named Shri. The 
detailed description of all these should be read as aforesaid. 
In Vanijyagram city lived a courtesan named Kamadhvaja. She was endowed 
with a beautiful body having five fully developed sense organs. She was proficient in 
seventy two arts (kalaa), endowed with the sixty four qualities of a courtesan, an 
exponent of all the twenty nine types of entertainments, an expert of twenty one styles 
of sex plays, and accomplished in thirty two styles of interactions with males (mentioned 
in the compendium of sexology or Kamashastra). Her nine latent sense organs were 
animated. She had good command over eighteen indigenous languages. She dressed 
in style and was the embodiment of adornment. She was primarily romantic and 
excelled i . Singing and music (geet), sex play (rati), dance drama (gandharva) and dance 
(nritya). She was a charming and artful mover in the social and physical dimensions.

She had voluptuous breasts. Her charges for a night's entertainment were one thousand 
coins. A flag was hoisted high on her residence. The king had honoured her with an 
umbrella, whisks and fans. The palanquin she usedfor commuting was named 
Karnirath. Having one thousand courtesans under her command, she lived happily. 
Commentary—The detailed description of courtesan Kamadhvaja in the 
beginning of the chapter may astonish the reader and invoke a curiosity as to why such 
detailed description of a courtesan? ""This provides a glimpse of the art and culture of that 
period. Kamadhvaja was not just an ordinary courtesan or a state dancer, she was an 
accomplished artist. The purpose of mentioning her qualities and qualifications in the field 
of arts and showing her to be an accomplished artist, intelligent individual, adept socialite 
and expert of numerous subjects is to reveal that women of that period were highly 
qualified in various subjects and skilled in performing arts even when they belonged to a 
lower caste or subsisting on some mean or lowly profession. 
The author of the work informs about the highly advanced state of art and culture 
in that period by mentioning about the expertise of eighteen languages, music, singing, 
dance and other performing arts. 
Detailed description of the 64 qualities of a courtesan is available in Kama Sutra 
of Vatsyayan.  
Navangasuttapadibohiya- Her nine latent sense organs were animated. The nine 
sense organs are—two ears, two eyes, two nose-holes, one tongue, one skin (organ of 
touch) and one mind. In context of sexua! Sensitivity these nine organs are latent or free 
of perversions during childhood. When the sexual sensitivity is activated or animated it 
is accepted as the beginning of youth or marriageable age. 
[12] Meaning- In that Vanijyagram city lived a rich caravan chief (sarthavaha) 
named Vijayamitra who had a wife named Subhadra having beautiful body with five fully 
developed sense organs. Vijayamitra and Subhadra had a perfect and beautiful son 
named Ujjhitak. 
During that period of time Shraman Bhagavan Mahavir arrived at Dutipalash 
Chaitya in Vanijyagram city. People came to pay homage. Like king Kunik the king of 
the city also came to pay homage. Bhagavan gave his discourse to all, after which the 
king and the people returned home. 
During that period of time the senior disciple of Shraman Bhagavan Mahavir was ascetic 
Indrabhuti (Gautam Swami). He had ingested Tejoleshya (firepower) after toning it down. He was 
observing a series of two day fasts interspersed with a day of meals. He used to spend first 
quarter of the day in studies and so on as mentioned in Bhagavati Sutra. He sauntered to 
Bhagavan Mahavir and asked—""Bhante ! Seeking your permission I want to go to Vanijyagram 
city and visit low, medium, and high caste families to collect alms from all for breaking my two day 
fast (shashtakhaman tap)."" 
Bhagavan replied—""Gautam ! Do as you please."" 
On getting permission from Shraman Bhagavan Mahavir, Bhagavan Gautam left 
Dutipalash garden and after collecting alms from low, medium and high caste families 
came to the main road.

On that main road he saw many elephants. These elephants were battle-ready. They 
were adorned with armour plates and other protective coverings like caparisons (jhool). Their 
bellies were tightened with belts. Large bells were hanging on both sides of the caparisons. 
These bells werestudded with a variety of gems and beads. These elephants were 
further embellished with ornaments including necklaces. They were also wearing Uttar 
Kanchuk (a special additional armour plate) and other armour plates and embellishments. 
They were also adorned with three kinds of flags (with emblems of eagle and other motifs), 
two kinds of streamers (without any markings), and five kinds of head-ornaments. 
Mahouts carrying weapons including ayudhs (hand-held like sword) and praharans 
(weapons that can be launched or thrown like arrow). 
He also saw many battle-ready horses equipped with armour plates and other 
protective coverings. These horses were covered with golden caparisons with hanging 
chains. They were harnessed with bridles and driving reins. They were gnashing their 
teeth in anger. Their middle was strapped with plumed belly-band and other ornaments 
(sthasak). The horsemen riding them carried weapons including ayudhs and praharans. 
He also saw many men (soldiers) who were wearing stoutly strapped armours 
with pointed projections. They had tightly strapped their arms with protective leather 
straps needed when drawing bow-string. Their necks were adorned with necklaces. 
They were also wearing identifying emblems and strips made of cloth. Equipped with 
ayudhs and praharans, they were battle-ready. 
Amongst these soldiers Bhagavan Gautam saw a person whose shackled hands 
were tied at his back with a rope. His nose and earlobes had been severed. His body 
was smeared with oil. His waist and hands were covered with rags fit for a man 
condemned to death. On his neck dangled a garland of red flowers. His whole body was 
covered with red chalk. 
That man was trembling with fear. Although he dearly loved his life and wanted to 
live, he was being cut piece by piece. His body was being chopped into small pieces of 
the size of Kakini (a small coin). Surrounded by many men and women, that sinful 
person was being hit by hundreds of stones and whips. At every crossing a broken 
drum was being beaten and an announcement made-  
""Listen gentlemen! It is no king or prince who inflicts this punishment to this boy 
Ujjhitak. It is only his sinful deeds that are responsible for his miserable condition. 
[13] Meaning- On seeing that person on the main road Bhagavan Gautam thought 
and pondered- ""Oh ! How much infernal torture this man is suffering!"" With this thought 
Bhagavan Gautam collected required alms from houses in Vanijyagram city and returned to 
Bhagavan Mahavir. He placed the alms before Bhagavan and after paying him homage 
and obeisance said— 
""Bhante! On getting your permission I went to Vanijyagram city to seek alms. 
There I saw a person suffering infernal torture. Bhante! In his earlier birth who was this 
person that now suffers such infernal torture? 
 (Narrating the story of previous birth of that person Shraman Bhagavan Mahavir said—)

Bharatvarsh area in Jambu continent. A king named Sunand was the ruler of that city. 
He was as majestic as the Himalayas. 
In the central part of Hastinapur city there was a large and beautiful cow-shed 
made up of hundreds of pillars. There dwelt numerous cows, oxen, small cows (calves), 
bulls and other cattle belonging to some one or belonging to no one. They got abundant 
grass (feed) and water and lived in comfort and without any fear or pain. 
In that Hastinapur city lived a kootagraha (trapper) named Bheem. He was by 
nature irreligious and derived pleasure in sinful deeds. Name of that Bheem trapper's 
wife was Utpalaa, who was well-proportioned. Once Utpalaa became pregnant. After 
three months of pregnancy she had a dohad (pregnancy desire). 
""Blessed, fortunate, and contented are those mothers who brown, fry, roast, dry and salt 
the meat from the udders (oodhas), breasts, testicles (vrishan), tails, humps (kukud), shoulders, 
ears, eyes, noses, tongues, lips, and dewlaps (kambal) of cows,... and so on up to ...and other 
cattle belonging to some one or belonging to no one. And then they enjoy tasting and eating, 
distributing (paribhajan) and sharing with their friends (paribhog) a little or more with a variety of 
wines (sura), namely madhu (made from flowers or honey), merak (made from palm-fruit), madya (a 
kind of white wine), seedhu (made from mixture of jaggery and grains), and prasanna (made from 
grapes). And thus fulfill their dohad. I wish I too fulfilled my dohad in the same way."" 
After these thoughts and because the dohad (desires of a pregnant mother) was not 
fulfilled, Utpalaa, the wife of the trapper, became anemic, emaciated, and weak like a famished 
person. Her skeleton showed as she lost her fat. Like a sick person she lost the natural 
freshness and glow, and the healthy pink of her face was replaced by a sick gloom. Her body 
became dull and pale. Her eyes and face withered. She became apathetic to any and all 
sorts of cosmetics and adornments including flowers, perfumes, garlands, and 
ornaments. Wilted like a crushed garland of lotus flowers and devoid of rationality, she 
plunged into the sea of grief and misery. 
At that time Bheem trapper came where Utpalaa was sitting and found her sad 
and gloomy. He asked—""Beloved of gods! Why are you so gloomy (sitting with your chin 
in your palms)?  Utpalaa responded—""My lord ! After three months of pregnancy I am filled 
with this dohad (pregnancy desire)—`Blessed are those mothers who brown, fry, roast, dry and 
salt the meat from the udders (oodhas),... and so on up to... And thus fulfill their dohad.' 
Because the dohad has not been fulfilled I have become anemic,... and so on up to... and 
plunged into the sea of grief and misery."" 
 (At these words) Bheem trapper said to his wife Utpalaa—""Beloved of gods! Don't be sad 
and gloomy. I will do all what is required to fulfill this dohad."" Thus he gave assurance to Utpalaa 
in sweet agreeable words. 
Later, dressed in strong armour and carrying bow, arrows, and sword, Bheem trapper 
left his house alone during the night. Crossing the city he came to the cow-shed and cut off the 
udders, dewlaps and other parts of some cows, calves, and other animals. Having done that 
he brought these parts home and gave them to his wife Utpalaa.                                              .  
 
Then Utpalaa sated her dohad by consuming these pieces of beef with a variety of 
wines. Thus her dohad was fulfilled, honoured, complied with, and removed. Having attained 
thisshe bore the fetus happily.

[14] Meaning-  After nine months of pregnancy, Utpalaa gave birth to a male child. 
The moment the child was born he produced a piercing fiendish shriek and wailed. Hearing 
this harsh shriek and wail many cows, calves, and bulls in Hastinapur ran helter-skelter with 
fear and anxiety. 
Observing this his parents, during his naming ceremony, announced—the moment 
this child was born he produced a piercing shriek and wailed. Hearing this harsh shriek and 
wail many cows, calves, and bulls in Hastinapur ran helter-skelter with fear and anxiety. 
Therefore we give this child the name ""Gotras"" (one who terrifies cows). 
Commentary- explaining terms `bhiya, `tattha; etc. Abhayadev Suri, commentator 
mentions- ""Hearing the fearful and ear-piercing fiendish shriek and wail of that new born, 
cattle in city became apprehensive and afraid. Filled with the apprehension that someone 
who will deprive us of our life has arrived, they were terrified and restless. They were in an 
agitated state of mind, their bodies trembled with fear and they ran around in disorder.  
Φ Meaning- (After Gotras became mature, oneday) Bheem Kootagraha died. Young 
Gotras cremated his father, Bheem Kootagraha, crying, weeping, and sobbing in the 
company of his friends, kinfolk, family members, relatives and other people. He 
performed the formal last rites as well. 
Some time later king Sunand appointed young Gotras at the post of Kootagraha. 
Gotras (like his father) was also by nature irreligious, derived pleasure in sinful deeds. 
Then every night that Gotras trapper would leave his house alone dressed in strong 
armour like a soldier and equipped with a bow, arrows, and a sword. He would come to the 
cow-shed and cut off the body-parts of some cows and other cattle. Doing that he would bring 
these parts home. He would then spend his time enjoying consuming these pieces of beef, 
duly cooked various ways, with a variety of wines. 
Considering this kind of cruel acts to be his duty, giving importance to, being well 
versed in, and being engrossed in such deeds, that Gotras Kootagraha continued to 
accumulate intense bad karmas. Completing his life span of five hundred years, he died 
in anxiety and misery and took rebirth as an infernal being in the second hell having a 
maximum life span of three Sagaropam. 
[15] Meaning- Subhadra, the wife of Vijayamitra Sarthavaha (a resident of that 
Vanijyagram), was a jatunandika (a woman whose offspring die at birth). On leaving the 
second hell, the soul of that Gotras K'ootagraha was conceived as a son in the womb of 
Subhadra, the wife of Vijayamitra Sarthavaha in Vanijyagram. On completion of nine 
months Subhadra Sarthavahi gave birth to a son. 
Subhadra Sarthavahi got the newborn thrown on a heap of trash and then got it back. 
After that she fed, protected and gradually brought up the child. The parents performed ritual 
ceremonies, including distribution of gifts, connected with the birth of a son. They performed the

passed, on the twelfth day they performed the naming ceremony—""When this son of ours was 
born he was thrown on a heap of trash, as such, he should be popularly known by the name 
`Ujjhitak' (the discarded one).""

Boy Ujjhitak was brought up under the care of five nurse-maids. They were—(1) Kshir 
Dhatri or milk-nurse-maid—the one who took charge of feeding; (2) Majjan Dhatri or bath-
nurse-maid—the one who took charge of giving a bath; (3) Mandan Dhatri or dress-nurse-
maid—the one who took charge of putting on dress and ornaments; (4) Kridayan Dhatri or 
play-nurse- maid—the one who took charge of playing with the baby; (5) Anka Dhatri or lap-
nurse-maid—the one who took charge of keeping the baby in her lap. Under the care of 
these nursemaids, like Dridhapratijna, he grew happily as a Champa tree grows in a 
mountain cave undisturbed by the blowing winds. 
Commentary- In this connection the commentator (Tikakaar) informs that during 
that period there was a general belief that when more than one offspring died on birth, a 
mother performed rituals like throwing the nextinfant on a heap of trash, placing it on a 
winnowing basket, etc. That wasthe reason Subhadra threw the new born on a heap of 
trash and brought him back. 
Φ Meaning- One day Vijayamitra Sarthavaha set out for a sea voyage in the Lavan 
Samudra. He filled the holds of his ship with a variety of merchandise. This included the four 
categories of goods—Ganim or the goods that are sold in numbers, such as coconut. Dharim 
or the goods that are sold by weight, such as sugar, butter, oil, etc. Meya or the goods that are 
sold by measurement, such as cloth, tape etc. Paaricchedya or the goods that are sold in 
pieces after testing, such as diamond, emerald, etc. After loading, the ship sailed. But the ship 
capsized in the Lavan Samudra andall the valuable merchandise belonging to Vijayamitra 
drowned in the sea. In absence of any protection or refuge, he himself died helplessly. 
When numerous influential and rich persons (ishvar), knights of honour (talavar), 
landlords (mandavik), heads of large families (kautumbik), affluent people (ibhya), established 
merchants (shreshti), and caravan chiefs (sarthavaha) living in Vanijyagram got the news 
that Vijayamitra's ship had capsized in the Lavan Samudra, all the valuable merchandise 
belonging to Vijayamitra was swept away in the sea, and he himself had died, they eloped 
from Vanijyagram with hastnikshep (deposits without any witness) and bahya bhaandasar 
(deposits made in presence of a witness) belonging to Vijayamitra. 
When Subhadra Sarthavahi got the news that Vijayamitra's ship had capsized in the 
Lavan Samudra, all the valuable merchandise belonging to Vijayamitra was swept away in 
the sea, and he himself had died, she was overwhelmed with the grief of loosing her 
husband. She fell prostrate on the ground like a cut Champak creeper. After some time she 
regained consciousness. Then surrounded by her friends and relatives she performed the 
last rites of Vijayamitra crying, weeping and wailing. 
Brooding about her husband's sea voyage, ship wreck, loss of wealth and husband, 
that grief stricken Subhadra Sarthavahi also met her end soon. 
[16] Meaning-  On getting the news of the demise of Subhadra Sarthavahi the city 
guards and officers expelled young Ujjhitak from his house and handed over the house to 
some other person (who was a creditor of Ujjhitak's father, house was given to him, Uttamarn, in 
exchange of the due amount). On being expelled from his house, young Ujjhitak started 
roaming around the trisections, crossings, roads, streets, gambling dens, whorehouses 
and bars. Thus leading an unrestricted, freewheeling and unbridled life he got addicted

Once queen ShriDevi, consort of king Vijayamitra of that city, got some vaginal 
ailment. As a result she became unfit for enjoying conjugal pleasures with king. At some 
point of time king Vijayamitra got young Ujjhitak expelled from the house of Kamadhvaja 
courtesan and started enjoying all human comforts and carnal pleasures with courtesan. 
On getting expelled from the house of Kamadhvaja courtesan, that young Ujjhitak 
being madly attached (murchhit) with Kamadhvaja courtesan, infatuated (gruddha) with 
her, entrapped in her love (grathit), and lost in her thoughts (adyupapanna), could not 
think of loving any other person or thing and deriving mental peace. Always thinking 
about her, making efforts to possess her, devoting his mind speech and body to her, 
driven by his desire for her, he got himself involved in seeking an opportunity when the 
king did not come to courtesan Kamadhvaja's house, when no other royal person was 
there and when even an ordinary person was also not there. 
At some point of time as soon as that young Ujjhitak got such an opportunity he 
stealthily entered the house of Kamadhvaja courtesan and started enjoying all human 
comforts and carnal pleasures with her. 
Commentary—This aphorism contains numerous synonyms that indicate that so 
many words have been used to convey just a single idea. But the commentator opines 
that in the sermon of the Detached no word is either meaningless or repeated. There is 
a subtle difference in the meanings ofeach of these synonyms defining the minute 
variations in his mental state. For example— 
Muchchhiye—murchchhit; irrational state of mind. 
Giddhe—gruddha; a licentious person; one who pounces like a vulture. 
Gadhiye—grathit; entrapped in bonds of love. 
Ajjhovavanne--adhypapanna; obsessive involvement in possessing some thing. 
Tachchitte—tadchitta; obsessed state of psyche. 
Tammane—tadman; obsessed state of mind; 
Tallese—tadleshya; obsessed state of soul 
TadAjjavasane—tadadhyavasaya; engaged in owning some thing. 
Tadatthovautte—tadarthopayukt; carefully engaged in fulfilling one's desires 
Tadappiyakarane--tadarpit karan; devoting all physical efforts to a goal. 
Tabbhavanabhaviye—tadbhaavana bhaavit; devoting all mental efforts to a goal.  
Φ Meaning- Then one day king Vijayamitra, after taking his bath, applying 
auspicious mark on his forehead, embellished fully with ornaments, and accompanied by a 
throng of people, went to the house of Kamadhvaja courtesan. There he came across 
young Ujjhitak enjoying all human comforts and carnal pleasures with Kamadhvaja 
courtesan. As soon as he saw this he turned red with anger and became violent. Raising 
his eyebrows he got young Ujjhitak caught by his guards. After that he gave Ujjhitak a 
thorough beating by hammering and tossing his body with blows of stick, fist, knee, and 
elbow. Having done that the king got him tied in the avakotak bond (bending the neck and 
tying it with hands already tied at the back) and sentenced him to death.

Gautam! This way that young Ujjhitak is suffering for the sinful deeds he 
committed in the past. 
[17] Meaning- Gautam Swami asked- ""Bhante ! After his death where will this 
young Ujjhitak go? Where will he be reborn?” 
Bhagavan replied- Gautam! After completing his life-span of twenty five years, 
this young Ujjhitak will die in the gallows this afternoon and will reincarnate as an 
infernal being in the first hell named Ratnaprabha. 
Getting out from there, he will take rebirth as a monkey in a monkey family at the foot 
of the Vaitadhya Mountain. On maturing he will turn to be an animal involved and infatuated 
with and entrapped in carnal pleasures. He will keep on killing newborn monkeys. 
Involved in such atrocious deeds he will complete his life-span and will be reborn as a 
son in the house of a courtesan in the city of Indrapur in this Jambu continent. On birth 
his parents will castrate him and train him as a eunuch. On the twelfth day after his birth 
they will name him as Priyasen. That Priyasen eunuch will have beautiful, youthful, 
charming and attractive body. 
Eunuch Priyasen will bring various kings, rich merchants, and other such people of 
Indrapur city under his control with the help of a variety of magical powers, mantra-charged 
powders and ash, and other methods of mesmerizing, hypnotizing, enticing and captivating, 
and spend his time enjoying all human comforts and carnal pleasures. 
Thus that Priyasen eunuch will aim only at such sinful activities and consider them to 
be his only duty and lofty conduct. As a consequence of these evil deeds he will acquire 
abundant demeritorious karmas. Having completed his life-span of one hundred twenty one 
years, at the time of death he will die and take rebirth as an infernal being in the first hell 
named Ratnaprabha. From there he will reincarnate in the genuses of non-limbed reptilians 
and other such beings. From there he will follow the cycles of rebirth as mentioned in 
context of Mrugaputra in the first chapter... and so on up to... will be born as earth-bodied 
and other such beings. 
Coming out from there he will be born as a buffalo in Champa city in Bharatvarsh 
area in this Jambu continent. After being killed by other buffaloes he will reincarnate as 
a son in a merchant family of the same city. On crossing adolescence and attaining 
youth, he will gain unambiguous and faultless righteousness (samyaktva) in the company 
of disciplined ascetics and get initiated as an ascetic. From there he will reincarnate in 
the first heaven named Saudharm Devlok... and so on up to... Like Mrugaputra he will 
shed all his karmas.

Φ INTRODUCTION:- 
In this third chapter the consequences or fruits of stealing, looting, violence, murder 
and other such cruel and criminal acts committed by Abhagnasen, the villainous leader of 
thieves, are narrated. It is noteworthy that in his previous birth he was a prominent trader of 
eggs. He was a gourmand and in order to satiate his taste buds he killed animals and ate 
meat besides trading in eggs, meat and wine. When such sinner was conceived, his 
mother too had desire of killing animals and consuming meat and wine during her 
pregnancy. This vivid dreadful description of Abhagnasen's plight, followed by the details of 
his passage through base genuses like hell and animal for numerous cycles of rebirth, 
gives inspiration to avoid evil deeds. 
[18] Meaning- The foreword of the third chapter should be read as before.  
During that period of time there was a city named Purimtal, which was prosperous in all 
respects including business, wealth and agriculture, and was well protected. In the northeastern 
direction (Ishan Kone) outside this town was a garden named Amoghadarshan. In that garden 
there was a temple of Amoghadarshi Yaksh. A king named Mahabal ruled that Purimtal City. 
In the outskirts of Purimtal city, in the northeastern direction there was a dense jungle. In that 
jungle was a hideout of thieves known as Shalatavi. It was located at an impregnable spot in a 
tedious hilly terrain at the edge of dangerous caves. A parapet-like network of bamboo thickets 
surrounded it. Around it there were large boulders, natural gorges, and high-low streams and 
waterfalls forming natural trenches. There was no source of water in the general area except the 
hideout proper. It had many small and concealed passages for entry and escape but only the 
acquainted could use them. It was difficult even for armed guards and trained detectives, coming in 
search of stolen goods, to reach this hideout and defeat the bandits. 
In Shalatavi lived the bandit leader Vijaya. He was absolutely corrupt... and so on up to... his 
hands were always red with blood. His notoriety had reached numerous towns. He was brave, 
ruthless, courageous, an expert marksman and an accomplished swordsman and stick fighter. He 
was the undisputed leader of the five hundred thieves of Shalatavi. 
Commentary- This aphorism contains some of the adjectives used to indicate 
the extreme cruelty of bandit Vijaya but there are some more as indicated by the phrase 
`ahammiye java' (irreligious and so on). Abhayadev Suri, commentator state as follows— 
1. 
Adharrni—evil doer. 
2. 
Adharmisht—one who loves evil or irreligious activity. 
3. 
Adhramakhyayi-one who preaches others to indulge in irreligious conduct. 
4. 
Adharmanujna-one who supports activities devoid of or against religiosity. 
5. 
Adharm praloki—one who always concentrates on evil activities. 
6. 
Adharmapraranjan—one whose only entertainment is evil deeds. 
7. 
Adharmasheel samudachar—one whose morality, style, attitude, and 
behaviour merge with evil doing. 
8. 
Adharma-vritti—one who subsists only on evil doing.

9. 
Hun chhind-bhind-vikartak—one who utters such dreadful wordslike'cut to 
pieces', 'tear apart', and 'slaughter'. 
These adjectives reveal his extremely cruel, harsh, and violent conduct and behaviour.  
[19] Meaning- Like a bamboo thicket bandit Vijaya provided protection and refuge in 
that bamboo forest to all sorts of branded and escaped criminals. These included thieves, 
womanizers (paardariks), bamboozlers (granthibhedak), housebreakers (sandhicchedak), wall-
breakers (kshatrakhanak), gamblers, transgressors, destitute, deformed, disabled, and all 
sorts of outcasts. In and around Purimtal city, that leader of bandits, Vijay, habitually indulged in 
activities like raiding villages, raiding towns, driving away cattle, kidnapping prisoners, looting 
and beating wayfarers, and house breaking. With these activities he tormented, wrecked, 
terrorized, thrashed people and deprived citizens of their wealth, means of subsistence and 
peaceful living. He also habitually looted and collected the taxes due to king Mahabal. 
That bandit-chief Vijaya had a beautiful wife named Skandashri. Bandit-chief 
Vijaya and Skandashri had a son named Abhagnasen who was a young man with a 
beautiful and well-proportioned body as well as a mature mind. 
During that period of time Shraman Bhagavan Mahavir arrived at Purimtal City. 
People came to pay homage. The king of the city also came to pay homage. Bhagavan 
gave his discourse to all, after which the king and the people returned home. 
 During that period of time, while returning after collecting alms in the city, Gautam 
Swami, the senior disciple of Shraman Bhagavan Mahavir, came to the main road. There he 
saw many elephants, horses and foot soldiers duly equipped with armours and weapons. 
Amongst them he saw a man tied in the avakotak bond (bending the neck and tying it with 
Already tied at the back). Announcement was being made about him.  
Those soldiers forced that prisoner to sit at the first road crossing (of many roads) and 
before his eyes killed his eight chachas (father's younger brothers; uncles; chullapiuye). After that 
they thrashed him with whips and, in this miserable condition, made him eat small pieces of 
his own flash and drink his own blood. Then those soldiers brought him on the second road 
crossing (of many roads), before his eyes killed his eight chachis (wives of father's younger 
brothers; aunts; chullamauyao), thrashed him and fed him his own flash and blood. In the same 
way they killed his six taus (father's elder brothers; uncles; mahapiuye) on the third crossing, his 
six tais (wives of father's elder brothers; aunts; mahamauyao) on the fourth crossing, sons (of his 
father excluding himself; his brothers) on the fifth crossing, daughters-in-law (of his father; wives of 
his brothers) on the sixth crossing, sons-in-law (of his father; husbands of his sisters) on the 
seventh crossing, daughters (of his father; his sisters) on the eighth crossing, grandsons (of his 
father; his nephews) on the ninth crossing, granddaughters (of his father; his nieces) on the tenth 
crossing, husbands of granddaughters (of his father) on the eleventh crossing, wives of 
grandsons (of his father) on the twelfth crossing, husbands of his father's sisters (his uncles) on 
the thirteenth crossing, father's sisters (his aunts) on the fourteenth crossing, husbands of his 
mother's sisters (his maternal uncles) on the fifteenth crossing, mother's sisters (his aunts) on 
the sixteenth crossing, wives of mother's brothers on the seventeenth crossing, and other 
friends, kinfolk, and close and distant relatives on the eighteenth crossing before his eyes. 
After each of these instances the soldiers thrashed him and, in this miserable condition, 
made him eat small pieces of his own flash and drink his own blood.

***** 
[20] Meaning-  Bhagavan Gautam was thoughtful (on seeing all this). He came out of 
the city, went to Bhagavan Mahavir and said—""Bhant ! On getting your permission I went 
into the city to seek alms. There I saw a person in pathetic condition (as aforesaid). Bhante ! 
In his earlier birth, who was this person that now suffers such grave fruits of his karmas?” 
(Narrating the story of previous birth of that person Shraman Bhagavan Mahavir said—) 
""Gautam! During that period of time there was a prosperous city called Purimtal in 
Bharatvarsh area in Jambu continent. A king named Udit was the ruler of that city. In that 
Purimtal city lived an egg trader named Nirnaya. He was very rich but irreligious and 
extremely discontented. He derived pleasure only in sinful deeds. 
Nirnaya egg-trader had many servants who were given food and cash as daily 
wages (dattabhritibhaktavetan). Every day they would go out of Purimtal City in all directions. 
They would collect eggs of crows, owls, pigeons, Titodis (sandpipers), Bagulas (herons), 
peacocks, hen, and many other aquatic, terrestrial and aerial beings. After filling the 
baskets with these eggs they would return to Nirnaya egg-trader and hand over the egg 
filled baskets to him. 
Many such servants of Nirnaya egg-trader fried, roasted and cooked large numbers 
of eggs of crows... and so on up to... hen, and many other aquatic, terrestrial and aerial 
beings on cooking-plates, frying-pans, ovens, and grills. They earned their living by grilling, 
frying, roasting and choking as well as selling eggs in shops and stalls on the main roads 
and markets in the streets. That Nirnaya egg-trader too ate such grilled, fried, roasted and 
cooked eggs of crows... and so on up to... hen and drank a variety of wines (sura), namely 
madhu (made from flowers or honey), merak (made from palm-fruit), madya (a kind of white 
wine), seedhu (made from mixture of jaggery and grains) etc. 
Involved in these kinds of cruel acts that Nirnaya egg-trader accumulated intense 
demeritorious karrnas. Completing his life span of one thousand years, he died at the destined 
moment of death and took rebirth as an infernal being in the third hell with a maximum life 
span of seven Sagaropam. On completing the life span in hell the soul tliat was Nirnaya egg-
trader came in the womb of Skandashri, the wife of bandit-chief Vijaya. 
[21] Meaning-  At some point of time, when about three months of the pregnancy 
period had passed, Skandashri had a dohad (pregnancy desire)—""Blessed are those 
mothers who, after bathing and embellishing themselves with all kinds of ornaments, enjoy 
tasting and eating, distributing and sharing with female friends, kinfolk, close and distant 
relatives and other women of the hideout, a variety of ashan, paan, khadya, svadya (staple 
food, liquids, general food, and savory food) and wines (sura), namely madhu etc. After this 
feast they dress themselves as males and tightly strap iron armours and equip themselves 
with swords, arrows, and other hand-wielding and launchable weapons. They move 
carrying shields in their left hands, brandishing drawn swords, quivers on their shouldeis, 
raised nets, and bows with arrows drawn on strings. Bells fixed on their thighs ring. 
Kshipraturya trumpets keep blowing. Filling the sky with such exhilarating tumult, matching 
the thunder of the sea, they move all around the hideout viewing everything. And thus they 
fulfill their dohad (desires of a pregnant mother). 
How pleasurable it would be if I am also able to fulfill my dohad  -  in the same way?” 
With this thought and not being able to fulfill her dohad she turned gloomy. In due  Course

she became emaciated and habitually sat staring at the ground and brooding. 
When bandit-chief Vijaya saw brooding and worrying Skandashri he asked-""Beloved 
of gods! What makes you sad and brooding'?"" 
Skandashri replied to bandit-chief Vijaya—""Beloved of gods! Three months are 
past since I conceived. I had the aforesaid dohad. As I am unable to fulfill it, I am sad 
and brooding."" 
Bandit-chief Vijaya heard and understood the aforesaid statement of his wife 
Skandashri and said---""Beloved of gods! Don't worry. You can fulfill your said dohad 
precisely as you wish."" 
Skandashri was pleased and contented to hear these words of her husband. Later 
she took her female friends, kinfolk, close and distant relatives and other women of the 
hideout, along. After bathing and embellishing themselves with all kinds of ornaments she 
started enjoying ample food and wines as much as she liked. After this feast they gathered 
at a suitable place, dressed up as males, and equipped themselves with armours and 
other aforesaid things. In their company she moved all around fulfilling her dohad (desires 
of pregnant mother). Then having her dohad fulfilled and satiated she carried fetus happily. 
Commentary—in this aphorism some special terms have been used in context of 
fulfillment of dohad. The five terms used have specific meanings and nuances. On the basis 
of the commentary (Tikakaar) by Abhayadev Suri -----------as follows— 
1. 
Sampunna dohala—one whose pregnancy-desire has been fulfilled. 
2. 
Sammaniya dohala—whose pregnancy-desire has been respected by 
providing the desired thing. 
3. 
Viniya dohala—who has become free of her pregnancy-desire 
4. 
Vochchhinna dohala—the craving for the desired thing has disappeared 
from her mind. 
5. 
Sampanna dohala—her mind is contented as a consequence of satiation 
of pregnancy-desire. 
These five terms convey the gradual changes in the state of mind of a woman 
with pregnancy-desire 
Φ Meaning-  Then after nine months of pregnancy Skandashri, the wife of bandit , 
chief Vijaya, gave birth to a son. For ten days bandit-chief Vijaya performed the birth 
ceremonies, following his family tradition, by offering feasts and , gifts to invitees and 
honouring the elders. On the eleventh day after the birth he arranged for ample food (etc.) 
and invited his friends and relatives. After the feast he announced—""When this child was 
conceived his motherhad a dohad. That dohad was fulfilled without any problem. Therefore, 
I give this boy the name Abhagriaserf (Abhagna means unbroken. As the dohad was fulfilled 
and not shattered, the boy was named Abhagna.)"" 
Gradually that boy Abhagnasen grew in the care of five nursemaids including the 
milk-nursemaid. 
[22] Meaning- In due course boy Abhagnasen crossed adolescence and attained 
youth. He was married to eight young women. His parents gave him eight sets of things 
as marriage gifts. He lived happily in lofty mansions enjoying all these gifts.

***** 
Then at some point of time bandit-chief Vijaya died. 
On his death, young Abhagnasen, crying, weeping and wailing performed the 
cremation rites of bandit-chief Vijaya with honour, respect and great pomp and show in 
presence of five hundred bandits. He also performed the worldly last rites for his deceased 
father, including charity and offering food. As time passed he emerged out of the grief of the 
loss of his father. 
Some time later, those five hundred bandits ceremoniously conferred the title and 
position of bandit-chief on Abhagnasen. On being appointed bandit-chief, Abhagnasen 
commenced extorting from people the taxes due to the king. 
Tortured and tormented by destruction of many villages by bandit-chief 
Abhagnasen, the people called a meeting and deliberated-  
""Beloved of gods! Bandit-chief Abhagnasen is destroying many villages north of 
Purimtal City and making them destitute by looting their wealth and grains. Therefore, 0 
beloved of gods! We should give this information to king Mahabal of Purimtal City."" 
After these deliberations the congregation of citizens accepted this proposal. They 
collected impressive (maharth) and valuable gifts suitable for a king and went into Purimtal 
City where king Mahabal resided. Touching their foreheads with joined palms (a gesture of 
offering respect) they presented the valuable gifts to the king. After that they submitted— 
""0 lord! Bandit-chief Abhagnasen of Shalatavi hideout is plundering villages and 
cities, depriving us of our wealth and making us poor. Sire! We wish to live happily, 
fearlessly and free from troubles in the protection and shelter of your arms."" With these 
words those citizens emphasized their plight by joining their palms and falling at king 
Mahabal's feet. 
Listening to the said details from those citizens king Mahabal got angry... and so on 
up to... red with rage. Gnashing his teeth in rage and raising his eyebrows (in other words, 
becoming embodiment of anger) he called the police chief and said—""Beloved of gods! Go, 
raid that Shalatavi hideout, destroy it and after capturing that bandit-chief Abhagnasen 
alive, present him before me."" 
The police chief humbly accepted this order by king Mahabal. Then he tightly 
strapped iron armours with sharp projections. He decided to take along many soldiers 
equipped with hand-wielding and launchable weapons and shields tied to their hands and 
pass through the middle of Purimtal city blowing Kshipraturya trumpets filling the sky with 
tremendous tumult matching the thunder of the sea. He resolved to cross the city thus and 
go to that Shalatavi hideout of bandits. 
At that time the spies of bandit-chief Abhagnasen came to know of this development. 
They approached bandit-chief Abhagnasen of Shalatavi hideout; touched their foreheads with 
joined palms, and submitted—""Beloved of gods ! In Purimtal city king Mahabal has called the 
police chief and brave soldiers and given this order—`Beloved of gods ! Go, raid that Shalatavi 
hideout, destroy it and present before me that bandit-chief Abhagnasen after capturing him 
alive.' Accepting the order of the king the police chief has left for Shalatavi hideout along with 
many brave soldiers."" 
On hearing the news given by his spies, bandit-chief Abhagnasen called five hundred 
bandits of his gang and said— “On getting the order from king. Mahabal the police chief of

Purimtal city has resolved to attack this hideout and capture me alive. Therefore, it would be to 
our benefit to stop that police chief on the way before he reaches Shalatavi hideout.""  
500 bandits accepted bandit-chief Abhagnasen's order by uttering-  ""Yes! We should do that."" 
After that, bandit-chief Abhagnasen arranged for abundant ashan, paan, and khadya, 
svadya (staple food, liquids, general food, and savory food). All five hundred bandits bathed and 
performed auspicious rituals including putting marks on their foreheads for the success of 
their mission. After that they started enjoying ample food and wines as much as they liked. 
After meals they went to an allotted spot and washed and wiped their mouths clean 
of any bits and pieces of food. After cleansing they performed the ritual of Ardracharm 
arohan (riding over wet leather). Then they tightly strapped iron armours with sharp 
projections, equipped themselves with hand-wielding and launchable weapons and shields 
tied to their hands. Then filling the sky with tremendous roar and loud war cry, they left the 
Shalatavi hideout around noon. Carrying large quantities of food, they stopped at a fortified 
area in the dense jungle and awaited the arrival of the police chief. 
Commentary—Ardracharm arohan (riding over wet leather)—What is the purport 
of this term? ""There are three different popularly accepted beliefs in this context— 
(1) 
       According to Acharya Shri Abhayadev Suri this Ardracharm arohan 
(riding over wet leather) was an auspicious ritual of bandits and thieves. Before launching 
their mission of waylaying the police chief, Abhagnasen and members of his gang 
performed this auspicious ritual with the wish of removing all possible hurdles. 
(2) 
The second and traditional belief is that the ritual of riding over wet leather 
signifies and symbolizes the resolve of embracing death instead of retreating in face of any 
favourable or unfavourable situation, no matter how tough or complex it is. This ritual riding 
over wet leather conveys the bond of the unwavering resolve- We will accomplish our mission 
no matter what it takes, otherwise we will abandon this body.' 
(3) 
The third belief is that as wet leather expands, likewise one who rides over it 
achieves the enhancement of his wealth and power. With this wish of enhancing his wealth 
and power bandit-chief Abhagnasen and his five hundred companions performed the ritual.  
Φ Meaning- Then that police chief came where bandit-chief Abhagnasen was waiting 
and engaged him in a battle. But soon bandit-chief Abhagnasen defeated the police chief, in 
other words the army lead by the police chief was trounced, its warriors were killed and its flag 
was destroyed. The police chief was subdued, wounded and beaten up and his company was 
made to run helter-skelter. 
On being wounded and made to retreat by bandit-chief Abhagnasen, that police chief 
lost his confidence (akaam), he became physically weak (abal), he lost his courage (avirya), 
his pride that he was brave shattered and he was drained of the energy of even lifting his 
weapons. Thinking that it was impossible to defeat the bandit-chief, he returned to king 
Mahabal in Purimtal City and joining his palms submitted humbly— 
""0 Lord ! Bandit-chief Abhagnasen camps in a dense forest in a difficult terrain 
with complex fortification and abundance of food and water. Therefore, he cannot be 
captured alive by an army of horse riders or elephant riders or charioteers or foot 
soldiers, not even by all these four combined.""

On getting this report from the police chief, king Mahabal started working on 
apprehending the bandit-chief by taking him into confidence through negotiations, diplomacy, 
and enticement. With this intent he started working on inspiring dissention among the 
personal companions, guards and followers as well as the friends, kinfolk, relatives, and 
family members of the bandit-chief by generously distributing cash, gold, gems and other 
valuables. He also started sending beautiful, impressive and valuable gifts suited for people 
of high status including kings. By sending a variety of such gifts he was able to take bandit-
chief Abhagnasen in his confidence. 
[23] Meaning- Some time later king Mahabal got a beautiful and huge 
Kootakarashala (a camouflaged house), with hundreds of pillars, constructed. It was 
very attractive and pleasing to look at. After that he announced a ten-day fete, free of 
any admission, fees, in that Kootakarashala specially designed for intrigues. He then 
called his servants and instructed—Gentlemen! Go to Shalatavi hideout and with joined 
palms convey this to bandit-chief Abhagnasen- 
""Beloved of gods! King Mahabal has announced a ten-day fete with many facilities 
and free of any admission fees in Purimtal City. Should we bring here for you the festive 
food and drinks as also flowers, dresses, garlands, ornaments and other gifts or would you 
be kind enough to present yourself there on this occasion?”  
Commentary—Kootakarashala (a camouflaged house) is a mansion builton a hilltop. 
It is closed from all sides and has just a single passage for « entry and exit. It has a 
dome like top.   
Abhayadev Suri, the commentator (Tikakaar  ), has quoted an ancient verse in context 
of the term `utsukkam Java'. This verse details twelve special conditions related to this fete or

 Φ Meaning- Joining their palms, the servants humbly accepted king Mahabal's order 
uttering—""As you say, sire!"" They came out of Purimtal City and came to Shalatavi hideout in short 
jaunts taking breakfasts and meals at comfortable resting-places. On reaching there, raising their 
joined palms to their heads they submitted before bandit-chief Abhagnasen— 
""Beloved of gods! King mahabal has announced a ten-day fete with many facilities and free 
of any admission fees in Purimtal City. Should we bring here for you the festive food and drinks as 
also flowers, dresses, garlands, ornaments and other gifts or would you be kind enough to grace the 
occasion?"" Bandit-chief Abhagnasen replied—""Gentlemen! I will certainly come to 
Purimtal City for this fete."" And he dismissed them with due honour and greetings. 
Then that bandit-chief Abhagnasen got ready after his bath, performing auspicious 
rites including putting mark on his forehead, and embellishing himself with a variety of 
ornaments. He came out of the Shalatavi hideout along with his friends, kinfolk, relatives 
and family members and came to king Mahabal in Purimtal City. On arriving there, raising 
his joined palms to his head he greeted king Mahabal with hails of victory and presented 
rich gifts. King Mahabal accepted bandit-chief Abhagnasen's gifts and bid him farewell with 
honour and greetings and with a request to stay at the Kootakarshala. After this, bandit-
chief Abhagnasen went and stayed in the Kootakarshala. 
Then king Mahabal called his servants and said—Get large quantities of ashan, 
paan, khadya, svadya (staple food, liquids, general food, and savory food), flowers, dresses, 
fragrant garlands, and ornaments;and five kinds of wines ready and take these to 
Kootakarashala for bandit-chief Abhagnasen. 
According to the king's order the servants took all these things there. 
Then that bandit-chief Abhagnasen took his bath embellished himself with all his 
ornaments and along with his friends, kinfolk, etc. started enjoying that abundant food 
and five kinds of wines again-again. Thus he spent his time getting intoxicated on them. 
 (After 
winning 
bandit-chief 
Abhagnasen's 
confidence,

chief Abhagnasen alive and present him before me."" 
The servants joined their palms and accepted the king's order. They captured 
bandit-chief Abhagnasen alive and brought him to king Mahabal. On getting Abhagnasen 
captured thus as an offender, King Mahabal ordered him to the gallows (as you witnessed). 
Shraman Bhagavan Mahavir added—""Gautam ! In this way that bandit-chief 
Abhagnasen is suffering extreme pain and agony, like that in hell, due to the fruition of 
demeritorious karmas acquired as a consequence of sinful deeds committed in the past.

Gautam Swami asked—""Bhagavan! Where will that bandit-chief Abhagnasen go 
after death? Where will he be born?” 
Bhagavan replied—""Gautam! After completing his life span of thirty-seven years this 
bandit-chief Abhagnasen will die in the gallows this afternoon and will reincarnate as an 
infernal being in the first hell named Ratnaprabha. His maximum life span there will be one 
Sagaropam. Getting out from the first hell he will continue to go around in cycles of rebirth 
like Mrigaputra, as mentioned in the first chapter... and so on up to... will be born millions of 
times as earth-bodied, water bodied, air-bodied, and fire-bodied beings.

Φ - INTRODUCTION: -- This story lucidly details the agonising consequences of cruelty to animals 
and non-vegetarianism. Although a butcher by profession, Chhannik enjoys killing animals and 
eating meat. He also indulges in lascivious activities and adultery. He gravely suffers the 
consequences for many births. 
[24] Meaning- The foreword of the third chapter should be read as before. Jambu 
Swami asked—""Bhante! When Shraman Bhagavan Mahavir, who has attained 
liberation, has preached the aforesaid 'text and meaning of the third chapter, then what 
is the text and meaning of the fourth chapter as preached by him?” 
Sudharma Swami replied—Jambu! During that period of time there was a city named 
Saahanjani which was beautiful, prosperous in all respects, and well secured. In the 
northeastern direction (Ishan Kone) outside this town was a garden named Devaraman. In 
that Devaraman garden there was an ancient temple of Amogh Yaksh. In that Saahanjani 
city ruled King Mahachandra. He was as majestic as the Himalayas. That King named 
Mahachandra had a minister named Sushen, who was well versed in four prongs of politics, 
namely saam (incantation), bhed, (guile), dand (threat), and upapradan (daam or bribery) as 
well as implementation of law. He was proficient in controlling anti-social elements. In 
Saahanjani city lived a courtesan named Sudarshana. Her description (should be read as that 
of Kamadhvaja courtesan as mentioned in chapter two.) 
In Saahanjani city lived a caravan chief (sarthavaha) named Subhadra. The name of 
Subhadra Sarthavaha's wife was Bhadraa. She was beautiful and perfect in every way.

Subhadra Sarthavaha and Bhadraa had a son named Shakat who was also endowed with 
perfect and beautiful body. 
During that period of time Shraman Bhagavan Mahavir arrived at Devaraman 
garden outside Saahanjani city. People and the king came to pay homage. Bhagavan 
gave his discourse to all after which the king and the people returned home. 
 During that period of time, while returning after collecting alms in the city, Gautam 
Swami, the senior disciple of Shraman Bhagavan Mahavir, came to the main road. There 
he saw many elephants, horses and foot soldiers duly equipped with armours and 
weapons. Amongst them he saw a man, accompanied by a woman, with his ears and nose 
cut off, tied in the avakotak bond (bending the neck and tying it with hands already tied at 
the back). Announcement was being made about him. Gautam Swami was thoughtful (on 
hearing the announcement, seeing all this, and the person in pathetic condition). He came 
to Bhagavan Mahavir and asked about it. In reply Bhagavan said— 
Gautam!  During that period of time there was a prosperous city, called Chhagalpur 
in Bharatvarsh area in Jambu continent. A king named-Simhagiri was the ruler of that city. 
He was as majestic as the Himalayas:, In that city lived a chhagalik (a butcher selling goat 
meat) named Chhannik who was rich, irreligious and evil, and he derived enjoyment in 
sinful deeds only. 
That Chhanik Chhagalik had many cattle-corrals which could accommodate hundreds 
and thousands of animals like goats, sheep, Rojhas (Neelagaya or black-buck), bulls, hares, 
young deer, pigs, lions, deer, peacocks and buffaloes. Such animals were stocked there. 
Numerous men were employed there on wages and food. They used to look after and protect 
these animals including goats... and so on up to... buffaloes. 
Those numerous men, employed on wages and food, used to butcher thousands 
of these animals including goats... and so on up to... buffaloes, cut and chop their meat 
with knives and shears, and give it to Chhanik Chhagalik. 
His many other servants earned their living by frying, baking, and roasting meat 
of those goats and other animals on metal and earthen plates, pans, and a variety of 
other cooking pots as well as with sticks on burning charcoal. 
That Chhanik too spent his life enjoying aforesaid dishes of meat of goats (etc.) 
with five kinds of wine.Chhanik Chhagalik had made it his daily duty to sell and eat meat of 
goats (etc.) and drink five kinds of wine. He was ever involved in these sinful activities. These 
activities had become his way and ideal of life and he had accepted all these sinful activities to 
be the best of conduct. As a consequence he acquired extremely malevolent and pain 
causing karmas in abundance. After completing his life-span of seven hundred years, he 
died and reincarnated as an infernal being in the fourth hell where the maximum life 
span is ten Sagaropam. 
[25] Meaning- Bhadraa, the wife of Subhadra Sarthavaha was a jatunandika (a 
woman whose offspring die at birth). On leaving the fourth hell, the soul of that Chhanik 
Chhagalik was conceived as a son in the womb of Bhadraa, the wife of Subhadra 
Sarthavaha in Saahanjani city. 
In due course, on completion of nine months, Bhadraa Sarthavahi gave birth to a 
son. Immediately after his birth the parents placed the child under a shakat (bullock cart)

and then lifted it back. After that they fed, protected and gradually brought up the child. 
In due course the parents named the child—""When this son of ours was born he 
was placed under a cart (shakat). As such, he should be popularly known by the name 
`Shake."" Rest of the story should be read as that of Ujjhitak. 
Subhadra Sarthavaha met his death during a sea voyage in the Lavan Samudra. Soon 
grief stricken Bhadraa Sarthavahi also met her end. The city guards expelled young Shakat 
from his house. (They auctioned the house to repay loans to creditors and Shakat had to abandon his 
house). On being expelled from his house, young Shakat started roaming around the 
trisections, (etc.) in Saahanjani city and frequenting gambling houses (and bars). At one point 
of time he fell in love with courtesan Sudarshana. (As Ujjhit fell for Kamadhvaja.) 
Later at some point of time king Mahachandra's minister Sushen got young Shakat 
expelled from the house of Kamadhvaja courtesan and kept her as mistress in an 
independent house. He started enjoying all human comforts and carnal pleasures with the 
courtesan kept as his mistress. 
On getting expelled from the house of Sudarshana courtesan, that young Shakat, 
being madly attached (rnurchhit) with Sudarshana courtesan, infatuated (griddha) with her, 
entrapped in her love (grathit), lost in her thoughts (adyupapanna), could not think of, love 
and derive mental peace in any other person or thing. Always thinking about her, making 
efforts to possess her, devoting his mind speech and body to her, impelled by his desire for 
her, he got himself involved in seeking an opportunity when ttie king did not come to 
courtesan Sudarshana's house, when no other royal person was there and when even an 
ordinary person was also not there. Once he got such an opportunity and he stealthily 
entered the house of Sudarshana courtesan. He then started enjoying all human comforts 
and carnal pleasures with her. 
Then one day minister Sushen, after taking his bath,... and so on up to... embellished fully 
with ornaments, and accompanied by a throng of people went to the house of Sudarshana 
courtesan. There he came across young Shakat enjoying all human comforts and carnal pleasures 
with Sudarshana courtesan. When he saw this he turned red with anger and raised his eyebrows. 
He got young Shakat caught by his guards and gave a thorough beating by hammering and tossing 
the body of Shakat with blows of stick, fist,... and so on up to... got him tied in the avakotak bond 
(bending the neck and tying it with hands already tied at the back). He took Shakat to king 
Mahachandra and submitted—""Sire this young Shakat has committed the crime of entering my 
private quarters (where women of the house live)."" 
The king replied—""You are allowed to punish him as you like."" 
On getting permission from king Mahachandra, minister Sushen sentenced 
young Shakat and courtesan Sudarshana to death by aforesaid method (As you saw, 
Gautam!). Gautam! This way that young Shakat is suffering for the sinful deeds he 
committed in the past. 
[26] Meaning- Knowing the cause of Shakat's misery, Gautam Swami asked—
""Bhante ! After his death where will this young Shakat go ? Where will he be reborn? 
Bhagavan replied—Gautam ! After completing his life-span of fifty seven years, this 
afternoon young Shakat will be forced to embrace a large and fire-like red hot female statue

infernal being in the first hell named Ratnaprabha. 
Getting out of the hell them (the souls that are Shakat and Sudarshana) will take 
rebirth as twins in a Chandal (a low caste) family in Rajagriha city. The parents of the 
twins will name them as Shakat Kumar and Sudarshana. 
In due course Shakat Kumar will cross his adolescence and attain youth. 
Sudarshana Kumari will also acquire exceptional wisdom and maturity while attaining 
youth. She will have exquisitely beautiful, charming, and youthful body. 
Falling for the beauty, youth and charm of his own sister, Shakat Kumar will start 
passing his time enjoying all human comforts and carnal pleasures with Sudarshana. 
At some point of time that Shakat Kumar will enter the profession of catching and 
killing animals. As a kootagraha that Shakat Kumar will become extremely irreligious and 
derive contentment in sinful deeds. As a consequence of these evil deeds he will acquire 
abundant demeritorious karmas. Having completed his life-span, at the time of death, he will 
die and take rebirth as an infernal being in the first hell named Ratnaprabha. From there he 
will follow the cycles of rebirths as mentioned in context of Ekadi, Ujjhitak, and others... and 
so on up to... will be born millions of times as earth-bodied and other such beings. 
Coming out from there he will be born as a fish in Varanasi city. After being killed by 
fishermen he will reincarnate as a son in a merchant family of the same Varanasi city. 
There he will gain righteousness (samyaktva) and get initiated as an ascetic. From there he 
will reincarnate in the first heaven named Saudharm Devlok. Descending from there he will 
take birth in Mahavideh area and follow ascetic conduct immaculately. At last he will get 
enlightened and attain the status of Siddha shedding all his karmas and ending all misery.

Φ INTRODUCTION:-- Like the preceding chapters this fifth chapter too informs about 
the grave consequences and bitter fruits of cruelty, sinful activity, and adultery. Even though 
Brihaspatidatt was the state priest, he deceived his friend, the king, and indulged in adultery 
with the queen. He not only got harsh punishment for this evil deed during the same life 
time but he had to suffer the consequences of many other violent and sinful deeds, 
committed during this and many past births, for millions of rebirths. This chapter contains 
hair-raising description of that.

jambu! During that period of time there was a city named Kaushambi which was 
beautiful and prosperous in all respects. Outside this town was a garden named 
Chandravataran in which was a temple of Shvetabhadra Yaksh. 
In that Kaushambi city ruled a majestic king named Shataneek. The name of his 
queen was Mrigadevi who was the daughter of king Chetak. 
Shataneek and Mrigadevi had a son named Udayan who was perfectly 
proportioned and handsome. He was the crown prince of the kingdom. The name of 
prince Udayan's wife was Padmavati. 
The name of state priest of king Shataneek was Somadatt. He had mastery over 
Rigveda, Yajurveda, Saamaveda, Atharvaveda. Priest Somadatt's wife was Vasudatta. 
Sornadatt and Vasudatta had a perfect and handsome son named Brihaspatidatt. 
During that period of time Shraman Bhagavan Mahavir arrived at Chandravataran 
garden outside Kaushambi city. During that period of time while returning after collecting 
alms in Kaushambi city Bhagavan Gautam came to the main road as mentioned earlier. 
There he saw many elephants, horses and foot soldiers duly equipped with armours and 
weapons. Amongst them he saw a prisoner being taken to the gallows. Gautam Swami 
was thoughtful (on hearing the announcement, seeing all this and the person in pathetic 
condition). He came to Bhagavan Mahavir and asked about it. In reply Bhagavan said— 
Gautam During that period of time there was a prosperous city called 
Sarvatobhadra in Bharatvarsh area in Jambu continent. A king named Jitashatru was 
the ruler of that city. King Jitashatru had a priest named Maheshvardatt who had 
mastery over Rigveda, Yajurveda, Saamaveda, and Atharvaveda. 
Everyday priest Maheshvardatt would get a boy each from a Brahmin family, a Kshatriya 
family, a Vaishya family, and a Shudra family captured and brought to him. He would then get the 
hearts out from their live bodies and perform sacrificial peace-offerings for the well-being of king 
Jitashatru. The commentator (TikaKaar) has interpreted shanti-home (peace offerings) as: to throw 
butter, oil, barley etc. or lumps of human or animal flesh in sacrificial fire accompanied by 
chanting of mantras as offerings to some violence loving deity. It is hard to conceive what 
relationship the victory or well-being of a king can have with such violent act.  
Besides this that priest would also perform the ritual peace-offerings of lumps of flesh 
from hearts of two sets of boys every eighth and fourteenth day of a fortnight, of four sets of 
boys every four months, of eight sets of boys every six months, and of sixteen sets of boys 
every year. 
Whenever king Jitashatru fought a battle with some adversary, that priest Maheshvardatt 
would get one hundred eight boys each from Brahmin families, Kshatriya families, Vaishya 
families, and Shudra families captured and brought to him. He would then get the hearts out 
from their live bodies and perform sacrificial peace-offerings for the victory of king Jitashatru. 
This helped king Jitashatru destroy or trounce his enemy in the battle. 
[28] Meaning- Ever involved in these sinful activities, accepting these activities to 
be ideal of his life and the best of conduct, Priest Maheshvardatt acquired extremely 
malevolent and pain causing karmas in abundance. After completing his life-span of three 
thousand years, he died and reincarnated as an infernal being in the fifth hell where the 
maximum life span is seventeen Sagaropam (a metaphoric unit of time).

***** 
On leaving the fifth hell, the evil soul of that Priest Maheshvardatt was conceived 
as a son in the womb of Vasudatta, the wife of priest Somadatt in this Kaushambi city. 
On the twelfth day after his birth the parents named the child—""As the father of this boy 
is named Somadatt and the mother is named Vasudatta he should be popularly known 
by the name Brihaspatidatt'."" 
He was brought up under the care of five nursemaids. In due course he crossed 
adolescence and attained youth. While maturing in intelligence and wisdom he became 
a close friend of prince Udayan right since his childhood. This was because they were 
born at the same time and grew up playing together. 
At a certain time King Shataneek died. Crying, weeping, and sobbing, Prince Udayan 
performed the formal last rites and cremated his father, King Shataneek, with state honour 
and grandeur in presence of numerous kings, influential and rich persons (ishvar), knights of 
honour (talavar), landlords (mandavik), heads of large families (kautumbik), affluent people 
(ibhya), established merchants (shreshti), and caravan chiefs (sarthavaha) and other people. 
After that those numerous kings, influential and rich persons (ishvar),... and so on up 
to... caravan chiefs (sarthavaha) and other people joined the grand coronation ceremony 
and crowned prince Udayan. 
Prince Udayan became a king as majestic as the Himalayas. 
Then young Brihaspatidatt became king Udayan's priest and performing his duties 
as a priest started unrestricted movement at every place (bed chamber, dining hall, etc.) and 
getting involved in all activities (deliberations, meetings, state receipts including taxes, etc.) to 
the extant that he visited the private quarters of the king unchecked and at will. 
Then that Brihaspatidatt priest started frequenting at will the inner quarters of king 
Udayan's palace timely and untimely, at suitable or odd hours including morning, noon, 
evening, and night. Gradually he developed illicit relationship with Padmavati Devi and 
consequently started enjoying all human comforts and carnal pleasures with her. 
Then one day king Udayan, after taking his bath,... and so on up to... embellished fully 
with ornaments came to queen Padmavati Devi's palace. There he came across priest 
Brihaspatidatt enjoying all human comforts and carnal pleasures with Padmavati Devi. When 
he saw this he turned red with anger and raised his eyebrows. He got priest Brihaspatidatt 
caught by his guards and... and so on up to... (he gave a thorough beating and got his hands 
tied at the back) sentenced him to death. He sentenced him to harsh punishment as you have 
seen on the road. 
Gautam! This way that priest Brihaspatidatt is suffering for the sinful deeds he 
committed in the past. 
Gautam Swami asked—""Bhante! After his death where will this priest 
Brihaspatidatt go? Where will he be reborn? 
Bhagavan replied—Gautam! After completing his life-span of sixty four years, this 
afternoon priest Brihaspatidatt will die at the gallows and will reincarnate as an infernal 
being in the first hell named Ratnaprabha having a maximum life-span of one Sagaropam 
(a metaphoric unit of time). From there he will follow the cycles of rebirths as mentioned in the 
first chapter in context of Mrigaputra... and so on up to... will be born millions of times in all 
hells, as all animals, and as all one sensed beings.

Hastinapur city. 
There he will gain righteousness (samyaktva) and get initiated as an ascetic. From 
there he will reincarnate in the first heaven named Saudharm Devlok. Descending from 
there he will take birth in Mahavideh area and follow ascetic conduct immaculately. At

Φ INTRODUCTION:-- 
The sixth chapter contains the heart-rending description of the pathetic and horrific 
condition of prince Nandivardhan (Nandishen). Even a great sage like Gautam Swami was 
touched when he saw the infernal tortures suffered by him. 
Drawing the attention of Gautam Swami on the karmic cause of this torture 
Bhagavan says—""During this birth Nandivardhan goes against his father and wants to gain 
the kingdom by killing his father. He is being punished by the guards for this only. But at the 
root of this entire are the bad karmas acquired during the past birth, when he was 
Duryodhan, the jailer. The duty of a jailer is to protect people from rogues and tyrants and 
subdue evil. But when that protector, bereft of humanity, transforms into a demon and 
employs a ruthless and pitiless punitive policy that puts even demons to shame, he 
disgraces his post as well as humanity."" The extremely harsh system of punishment 
adopted by Duryodhan has been described in details in a hair-raising style by the author of 
this Agam. Shivers go through the spine while reading or listening to it. 
This story describes the fruits of these cruel and ruthless evil acts. This description 
reveals the meanest point of the harsh ancient system of punishment. 
At the beginning the title of this chapter is mentioned as Nandi, in aphorism 2 it 
as Nandivardhan, and in aphorism 10 as Nandishen. This appears to be a mistake 
committed by transcribes. 
[29] Meaning- Jambu Swami asked—""Bhante! When Shraman Bhagavan Mahavir, 
who has attained liberation, has preached the aforesaid text and meaning of the fifth chapter, 
then what is the text and meaning of the sixth chapter as preached by him ?""

Jambu! During that period of time there was a city named Mathura which was 
beautiful and prosperous in all respects. Outside this town was a garden named Bhandir in 
which was a temple of Sudarshan Yaksh. In that Mathura city ruled a majestic king named 
Shridaam. The name of his queen was Bandhushri. Shridaam and Bandhushri had a son 
named Nandivardhan who was perfectly proportioned and handsome. He was the crown 
prince of the kingdom. 
King Shridaam had a minister named Subandhu, who was well versed in four prongs 
of politics, namely saam (incantation), bhed, (guile), dand (threat), and upapradan (daam or 
bribery). The 'minister had a perfect and handsome son named Bahumitraputra. King 
Shridaam had a barber (alankarik or hair-styler). Besides performing all his duties as a 
beautician he was a confidante of the king. On king's order he had unrestricted access at 
every place and involvement in all activities to the extant that he visited the private quarters of 
the king's palace unchecked and at will. 
During that period of time Shraman Bhagavan Mahavir arrived in Mathura city. 
The king and the people came out of the city to attend his discourse. After the discourse 
they returned home. 
During that period of time Bhagavan Mahavir's senior disciple Ganadhar Gautam 
came to the city to seek alms. While returning after collecting alms he came to the main road. 
There he saw many elephants, horses and foot soldiers duly equipped with armours and 
weapons. Amongst them he saw a prisoner surrounded by many men and women. In the 
middle of the crossing the state guards made him sit on a red hot throne made of iron. After 
making him sit on the throne, as if lavishly anointing him for coronation, they poured on him, 
from red hot urns, a variety of bubbling and scalding liquids including—molten iron, molten 
copper, molten zinc, molten lead and boiling water. 
After that they embellished him with red hot eighteen and nine string necklaces 
on the neck, tied a red hot metal strap on his forehead and placed a crown and other 
ornaments of red hot iron on his head. 
Gautam Swami was touched at this horrifying scene. He was thoughtful- This 
man is, indeed suffering infernal torture and pain... and so on up to... He came to 
Bhagavan Mahavir and asked about past birth of that person. In reply Bhagavan said-- 
Gautam! During that period of time there was a prosperous city called Simhapur in 
Bharatvarsh area in Jambu continent. A king named Simharath was the ruler of that city. 
King Simharath had a jailer (charak-paal) named Duryodhan who was irreligious... and so 
on up to... enjoyed evil deeds only. 
 Jailer Duryodhan had numerous prison instruments (charak bhaand) for third 
degree torture of prisoners (listed as follows)-- 
A variety of iron pots (kundi) placed on fire always. Many of these were filled with copper, 
many with zinc (trapu), many with lead, and many others with alkaline or acidic water and oil (that 
gives burning sensation on touch). 
That Jailer Duryodhan had many large pitcher-like pots shaped like hump of a camel 
(ushtrika). Some of these were filled with urine of horses, others with that of elephants, 
camels, cows, buffaloes, goats, and sheep.

That Jailer Duryodhan had many1 wooden hand-cuffs (hastanduk), fetters for feet 
(padanduk), wooden shackles (hadi), iron shackles (nigad), and iron chains (shrinkhala). They were 
stored in stacks (punj) and bunches (nikar). 
               That Jailer Duryodhan had many stacks (punj) and bunches (nikar) of a variety of   whips 
made of bamboo creepers, cane creepers, tamarind creepers, 
           That Jailer Duryodhan had many stacks (punj) and bunches (nikar) of stone 
slabs, sticks, clubs or maces, and anchors (kanangar). 
That Jailer Duryodhan had many stacks (punj) and bunches (nikar) of ordinary ropes 
and those made of leather, hessian or other barks, woolen yarn, and cotton yarn. 
That Jailer Duryodhan had many stacks (punj) and bunches (nikar) of weapons 
like swords (asipatra), saw blades (karapatra), razor blades (kshurapatra), and 
kadambachirapatra (a kind of blade). 
That Jailer Duryodhan had many stacks (punj) and bunches (nikar) of iron nails, 
bamboo-pegs, leather straps, and hooks (allapatt). 
That Jailer Duryodhan had many stacks (punj) and bunches (nikar) of needles, 
rods (meant for hot piercing), and small maces. 
That Jailer Duryodhan had many stacks (punj) and bunches (nikar) of small 
weapons, small knives, axes, small chisels (nail-cutters), and other small tools with 
edges as sharp as a blade of grass. 
That Jailer Duryodhan would get captured, by king's police, different types of 
criminals including—thieves, adulterers, pick-pockets (granthibhedak), king's enemies, 
defaulters, killers of children, traitors, gamblers, and villains. He would then torture them 
many ways as follows— 
(1) 
Making them lie on their back, face upward (urdhvamukh), and opening 
mouths with iron bars, he would force some of them to swallow molten copper, molten zinc, 
lead, hot and alkaline or acidic water and oil. And some he would force to take bath with 
these scalding liquids. 
(2) 
Making many of them lie on their back, face upward, he would force some of 
them swallow urine of horses, elephants,... and so on up to... sheep. 
(3) 
Making many of them lie on their belly, face downward, he would force 
some of them to vomit with sounds of `chhad-chhad' (like sound of a whiplash), and 
some he would torment by forcing them swallow their own vomit. 
(4) 
Many of them he would shackle with wooden hand-cuffs, fetters for feet, 
wooden shackles (hadi), and iron shackles (nigad). Some he would torture by squeezing 
and twisting. Some he would tie with iron chains. 
(5) 
He would cut off hands of some. He would pierce and slit others with 
different types of weapons. 
(6) 
He would get some of them beaten with whips made of bamboo 
creepers,... and so on up to... hemp and other barks. 
(7) 
He would get some lie down on their backs and place heavy stone slabs 
or wooden logs on their chests. Having done that he would make policemen to heave 
the weights up and down in order to break the bones of the culprits.

(10) 
He would get nails and bamboo pegs hammered in heads, Adam's apples, 
elbows, knees, and heels of some and get hooks inserted in some. 
(11) 
Using small clubs he would get needles and other pointed instruments 
thrust in fingers and toes of some and force them to dig earth with these hands and feet. 
(12) 
With numerous chisel-like instruments he would get various parts of the 
bodies of some scraped and get these parts wrapped with darbh (grass with roots), kusha 
(grass without roots) and wet leather. After that he would prostrate them in sun and pull out 
the wrappings when dry, in order to make the skin peal off with `chad-chad' sound. 
 Ever involved in these sinful activities, accepting these activities to be ideal of his 
life and the best conduct, Jailer Duryodhan acquired extremely malevolent and pain 
causing karmas in abundance. After completing his life-span of three thousand one 
hundred years, he died and reincarnated in the sixth hell among the infernal beings having 
a maximum life span of twenty two Sagaropam (a metaphoric unit of time). 
 [30] Meaning- On leaving the sixth hell, the evil soul of that Jailer Duryodhan was 
conceived as a son in the womb of Bandhushri, the wife of king Shridaam in this Mathura 
city. On the twelfth day after his birth the parents named the child as Nandishen. 
He was brought up under the care of five nursemaids. In due course he crossed 
adolescence and attained youth and was made the crown prince. 
Having excessive craving for the kingdom and the harem, prince Nandishen was 
obsessed with the desire to kill king Shridaam and enjoy the royal wealth and power. 
Therefore, prince Nandishen got himself involved in seeking an opportunity when king 
Shridaam was alone, when no other royal person was there and when even an ordinary 
person was also not there. 
 When he did not get any such opportunity to kill king Shridaam, one day he called 
Chitra barber and said—""Beloved of gods! You have unrestricted access at every place, 
involvement in all activities, and you can visit even the private quarters of the king unchecked 
and at will (you are his close confidante). You regularly give him haircut and shave. As such, if 
while shaving king Shridaam you cut his throat and consequently the king dies, I will give you 
half the kingdom. Then, along with me, you will also be able to enjoy all the desirable and best 
of the pleasures and comforts and live happily ever after. 
Chitra barber remained silent at this statement from prince Nandishen. 
However, a little later Chitra barber was plagued with a doubt and apprehension—""If 
somehow king Shridaam comes to know of this conspiracy, I do not know what ghastly 
death he will deal me."" Terrified bythis thought he furtively went to the king when alone, 
and joining his palms submitted humbly— 
""My lord! I know it for a fact that, overwhelmed by his greed for thekingdom, 
princeNandishen is eager to possess kingdom and enjoy the royal wealth by killing you.""

Φ INTRODUCTION:-- 
This seventh chapter too informs about the grave consequences and bitter fruits 
of violent and cruel deeds committed during the past birth. However, there is a variation 
in the theme of this story-- 
Dhanvantari is a renowned Vaidya (an Ayurvedic doctor) who is so proficient in his 
subject of Ashtanga Chikitsa (the eight limbed science of healing) that he cures patients by mere 
touch. The profession of a Vaidya is a profession of beneficence. A healer can acquire 
meritorious karmas by removing misery and pain of masses with the help of his knowledge 
and expertise. But devoid of the feelings of altruism and compassion while practicing his 
profession of healing, when a doctor starts advising his patients to consume meat and 
alcohol, and encouraging them to indulge in violence besides consuming meat and wine 
himself, he transgresses the ethics of his profession. Besides this he also acquires highly 
demeritorious karmas through such cruel and violent activity. He suffers the grave 
consequences of same for many rebirths. This is what has been conveyed in this chapter.

[31] Meaning- The foreword of the seventh chapter should be read as before. 
(Jambu Swami asked—""Bhante! When this is the text and meaning of the sixth chapter 
of Duhkha-vipaak as preached by Shraman Bhagavan Mahavir, what is the text and 
meaning of the seventh chapter? 
 Jambu! During that period of time there was a city named Patalikhand. Outside 
this town was a garden named Vanakhand in which was a temple of Umbaradatt Yaksh. 
In Patalikhand city lived a rich caravan chief (sarthavaha) named Sagardatt who had 
a wife named Gangadatta. Sagardatt and Gangadatta had a perfect and beautiful son 
named Umbaradatt. He was fully endowed, well proportioned and handsome. 
During that period of time Shraman Bhagavan Mahavir arrived in the city. People 
came to pay homage. Bhagavan gave his discourse after which the king and the people 
returned home. 
 During that period of time Bhagavan Gautam Swami went into Patalikhand city 
in the afternoon to seek alms for breaking his two-day fast. He entered the city from the 
eastern gate. There he saw a man described as follows— 
He was suffering from Kandu or khaaj (Eczema) as well as Kodh (Leprosy), Jalodar 
(Dropsy), Bhagandar (fistula of the antis), and Bavaseer (bleeding piles). He was also suffering 
from diseases like Khansi (Bronchitis), Shvas (Asthma) and tumescence. His face was 
swollen and so were his hands and legs. His fingers, toes, nose and ears were in a state of 
decay. Dirty water and pus was oozing from the pulsating sores on his body. He was 
tormented by slithering worms in his wounds that were dripping blood and pus. His nose and 
ears had decayed into fibrous ooze. He was vomiting and the vomit contained shreds of 
coagulated pus, blood and worms. He was uttering piercing, pathetic, and plaintive sounds 
and words. Swarms of flies were following him. His hairs were disheveled. He was wearing 
rags. Carrying broken pitcher and broken earthen-cup in his extended hands, he was 
seeking alms from every house. 
Seeking and collecting required alms from high, medium, and low caste families 
Bhagavan Gautam Swami left Patalikhand city and came to Shraman Bhagavan 
Mahavir. After critical review (pratikraman) of his movement for alms collection he 
showed the food to Bhagavan. On getting permission, he ate his food without enjoying 
its taste and only for sustenance, like a snake entering its hole. He then spent his time 
enkindling his soul with discipline and austerities. 
Then on a second occasion on the day of breaking his two-day fast Bhagavan 
Gautam Swami did studies during the first quarter of the day and meditation during the 
second quarter of the day. During the third quarter he moved out and entered Patalikhand 
city from the southern gate. There also he saw the same person suffering from Eczema 
and other ailments in the same condition. He returned after collecting alms... and soon up 
to... He then spent his time enkindling his soul with discipline and austerities. 
Then on a third occasion on the day of breaking his two-day fast Bhagavan Gautam 
Swami entered Patalikhand city from the western gate. There also he saw the same person 
seeking alms in the same condition.In the same way on a fourth occasion on the day of 
breaking his two-day fast Bhagavan Gautam Swami entered Patalikhand city from the 
northern gate. There also he saw the same person seeking alms in the same condition.

Looking at his condition Bhagavan Gautam Swami thoughtfully contemplated—
""Oh! This man leads a miserable life suffering the fruits of sin as a consequence of the 
sinful karmas he acquired due to evil deeds committed in the past."" With these thoughts 
he returned and asked Bhagavan— 
""Bhagavan I went to Patalikhand city to collect alms. I entered the city from the eastern 
gate and saw a man suffering from Eczema and many other diseases. He was living on alms. 
Then on a second occasion on the day of breaking my two-day fast I entered the city from the 
southern gate. There also I saw the same person in the same condition. Then on a third 
occasion on the day of breaking my fast I entered the city from the western gate and again saw 
the same person in the same condition. Finally on a fourth occasion on the day of breaking my 
fast I entered the city from the northern gate and once again saw the same person in the same 
condition. On seeing him I thought ‘Oh! This man leads a miserable life suffering the fruits of 
sin as a consequence of the sinful karmas he acquired in the past.' (Etc.) 
""Bhante! Who was this person, suffering the agony of such terrible ailments, in 
his past birth?"" Bhagavan Mahavir replied as follows. 
Jambu! During that period of time there was a prosperous city named Vijayapur 
in Bharatvarsh area in Jambu continent. In that Vijayapur city ruled a king named 
Kanakarath. King Kanakarath had a Vaidya (Ayurvedic doctor) named Dhanvantari who 
was a scholar of all the eight limbs of Ayurveda (Indian Science of medicine and surgery). 
The names of these eight limbs of Ayurveda are as follows— 
Kaumarabhritya- The part of Ayurveda that deals with nursing, nutrition and 
cure of ailments of infants (Paediatrics). 
Shalakya- The part of Ayurveda that deals with the cure of diseases of eyes, 
nose and other parts of the upper half of the body. 
Shalyahatya- The part of Ayurveda that deals with the removal of thorns, cysts 
etc. or surgery. 
Kayachikitsa- The part of Ayurveda that deals with the symptoms and cure of 
diseases in general. 
Jangul- The part of Ayurveda that deals with the cure for poisons or toxicity. 
Bhoot-vidya- The part of Ayurveda that deals with warding off evil spirits and 
pacifying them. 
Rasayan- The part of Ayurveda that deals with the elixirs of life and other 
medicines. 
Baajikaran- The part of Ayurveda that deals with the medicines and tonics for 
maintaining and toning up sexual performance. 
That Dhanvantari Vaidya had a healing touch (shivahast). He had a pious and lucky 
touch (shubhahast). He had a skilled touch (laghuhast). In other words he cured his patients 
to their entire satisfaction with his skilled handling and treatment. 
That Dhanvantari Vaidya used to provide treatment to the queens residing in the 
inner quarters of king Kanakarath's palace. His patients included many kings, rich 
merchants, ... and so on up to... caravan chiefs; many other weak, mentally disturbed 
and ailing persons with or without guardians; Shramans, Brahmins, Bhikshuks, Karotiks

(Kapalik or the mendicants who carried skull), Karpatiks (mendicants in rags), beggars, and 
critically sick persons. 
To some of these he prescribed fish-meat, to some tortoise-meat, to some alligator-
meat, to some crocodile-meat, to some sumsumar-meat, and to some goat-meat. In the same 
way he also prescribed flesh of sheep, black-bucks, pigs, deer, rabbits, cows, and buffaloes. 
To many he prescribed meat of partridge, quail (lavak), pigeon, hen, and peacock. In the same 
way he advised for flesh from a variety of aquatic, terrestrial, and avian beings. 
Not only this, that- Dhanvantari Vaidya himself spent his time tasting (asvadan), eating in 
larger quantity or enjoying (visvadan) and sharing (paribhojan) habitually a variety of cooked, fried, 
and roasted meat of fish, peacocks... and so on up to... aquatic, terrestrial, and avian beings. He 
did that with five kinds of wines. 
 Ever involved in these sinful activities, accepting these activities to be ideal of his life and 
the best of conduct, Dhanvantari Vaidya acquired extremely malevolent and pain causing 
karmas in abundance. After completing his life-span of three thousand two hundred years, he 
died and reincarnated as an infernal being in the sixth hell where the maximum life span is 
twenty two Sagaropam (a metaphoric unit of time). 
Gangadatta, the wife of Sagaradatt, was a jatunandika (a woman whose offspring die 
at birth). One day while Gangadatta was thinking about family matters around midnight, an 
aspiration surfaced—""I have been enjoying my married life with Sagaradatt Sarthavaha. 
However, I have not been lucky enough to have given birth even to a single surviving boy 
or girl. Fulfilled is the life as humans of those mothers and blessed, fortunate, and 
meritorious are those mothers who have surviving children born to them. Who breast-feed 
their own children that are eager to suckle, sweetly stutter, and in stupor shift from the base 
of the breasts toward the armpit; and who have lifted the baby with their lotus-like tender 
and loving hands, put it in the lap and enjoyed sweet and loving talk with the baby. 
""I am, indeed, the wretched, ill-fated and unhappy one that has been deprived of 
any of these pleasures with even a single such offspring. Therefore it would be good for 
me that tomorrow at dawn after seeking permission from Sagaradatt Sarthavaha and, 
taking along numerous kinfolk, friends, near and far relatives and family members, I go 
to the temple of Umbaradatt Yaksh in the garden outside Patalikhand city carrying a 
variety of flowers, dresses, perfumes, garlands and ornaments. Arriving there I offer 
flowers and other things to Umbaradatt Yaksh, bow at his feet, and beg his favour 
thus— 
`Beloved of gods! If I give birth to a child who survives I will offer worship (yaag) and 
enhance your non-diminishing treasure (akshayanidhi) by gifts on auspicious days (daan), 
and share in profit (bhaag).' “She resolved thus to pray for the desired boon. Acting upon her 
resolve she went to Sagaradatt Sarthavaha at dawn and said to him—""My lord! I have 
been enjoying my married life with you. However, I have not given birth even to a single 
surviving boy or girl. Therefore, I want that if you give permission I will take along 
numerous kinfolk, friends, near and far relatives and family members, and go to the 
temple of Umbaradatt Yaksh in the garden outside Patalikhand city... and so on up to... 
perform highly beneficent flower-worship to get a son as boon.""

Sagaradatt .Sarthavaha replied—""Lady! I also desire that somehow you give 
birth to a surviving son or a daughter."" With these words he supported Gangadatta's 
proposal and gave her permission. 
 On getting permission from Sagaradatt Sarthavaha, Gangadatta took along 
numerous kinfolk, friends, near and far relatives and family members and left her house 
carrying a variety of flowers, dresses, perfumes, garlands and ornaments. Crossing 
Patalikhand city she came near a pushkarini (bavadi; a deep and elaborate masonry tank or 
well with steps down to the water level). She placed the flowers, dresses, perfumes, garlands 
and ornaments at one side on the bank and entered the bavadi. After dipping and playing 
around in the water she performed auspicious rituals like putting mark on her forehead. 
She came out of the pushkarini in wet sari (Indian female dress) and went to the temple. of 
Umbaradatt Yaksh with flowers and other worship material. As soon as she saw the 
Yaksh image she paid homage and cleansed the Yaksh image with a peacock feather 
broom. Then she anointed the image with water and wiped it dry with a saffron coloured 
perfumed soft cloth. After that she dressed the image in white garb and offered costly 
flowers, dresses, perfumes, garlands, incense powders suitable for deities. She then 
burned incense and with her knees on the ground bowed at the feet of the image. In this 
posture she submitted—""0 divine Yaksh ! If I give birth to a child who survives I will offer 
worship (yaag) and enhance your non-diminishing treasure (akshayanidhi) by gifts on 
auspicious days (dawn), and share in profit (bhaag)."" With these words she begged the 
deity's favour and returned home. 
The soul that was Dhanvantari Vaidya, coming out of the hell, was conceived as 
a son in the womb of Gangadatta in this Patalikhand city. After three months of 
pregnancy Gangadatta had a dohad (pregnancy-desire). 
""Fulfilled is the life as humans of those mothers and blessed... and so on up to... are 
those mothers who get ample staple food, liquids, general food, and savoury food (ashan, 
paan, khadya, svadya) prepared; take along numerous kinfolk, friends, near and far 
relatives and family members and, crossing Patalikhand city, go to a pushkarini (bavadi; a 
deep and elaborate masonry tank or well with steps down to the water level). They enter 
the bavadi. After dipping in the water and performing auspicious rituals like putting mark on 
forehead, they enjoy the food they brought along. And thus they fulfill their dohad."" 
Thinking thus, in the morning when the brilliant sun dawned, she came to 
Sagaradatt Sarthavaha and informed him about her dohad—""My lord ! Blessed are those 
mothers who satisfy their pregnancy-desire (dohad) (as aforesaid). I also want to satisfy my 
pregnancy-desire."" 
Then Sagaradatt Sarthavaha gave permission to wife Gangadatta to satisfy her 
dohad. 
On getting permission from Sagaradatt Sarthavaha, Gangadatta gets ample 
staple food, liquids, general food, and savoury food (ashan, paan, khadya, svadya) 
prepared. She then collects the food so prepared, Wines (etc.), flowers and other things 
needed for worship. Taking along numerous female kinfolk, friends, (etc.) and many other 
women she goes to a pushkarini (bavadi; a deep and elaborate masonry tank or well with steps 
down to the water level) and takes a dip. Performing auspicious rituals like putting mark on

her forehead, she enters the temple of Umbaradatt Yaksh. There she performs worship as 
before and burns incense. Once that is done she returns to the pushkarini. 
At the pushkarini the accompanying ladies embellish Gangadatta with all kinds of 
ornaments. Then Gangadatta enjoys the food and six kinds of wine they brought along 
and satisfies her dohad. She returns home once her dohad is satisfied. Pleased by the 
fulfillment of her dohad, Gangadatta carries the fetus happily. 
After nine months of pregnancy, that Gangadatta gave birth to a son. Following 
their family tradition, the parents celebrated the birth of their son. Then they performed 
the naming ceremony—""As this child was born through the favour of Umbaradatt Yaksh 
he should be named Umbaradatt."" And child Umbaradatt began to grow up in care of 
five nursemaids. 
Some time later Sagaradatt Sarthavaha died (like Vijayamitra during a sea 
voyage). In due course Gangadatta also died. Like Ujjhitak Umbaradatt was also 
expelled from his house by state guards and his house was given to some other person. 
(Helpless Umbaradatt starts living on alms.) At some point of time Umbaradatt was 
inflicted by sixteen diseases, namely Asthma, Bronchitis,... and so on up to... Leprosy. 
Suffering from these sixteen deadly diseases and with decayed limbs Umbaradatt leads a 
miserable life. 
Bhagavan added—""Gautam! This way that young Umbaradatt is biding his time 
in excruciating pain, suffering horribly for the sinful deeds he committed in the past. That 
is what you just saw."" 
Commentary- almost all stories in this book describe a common situation that the son 
is expelled from the house by state officials on death of his parents. The commentator (Tika) 
surmises that at the time of going on asea voyage for trading, the seafaring merchant must 
have taken loans from other merchants. When the ship capsized he lost all his 
merchandise and wealth. The creditors must have appealed to the king for realization of 
their dues and the king must have ordered to auction the property after expelling the heirs. 
This could be the prevalent practice at that time. That must have been the reason for the 
sons of defaulters to go begging house to house for living. 
 Meaning-.Gautam Swami asked—""Bhante! After his death where will this 
Umbaradatt go? Where will he be reborn? 
Bhagavan replied—Gautam! After completing his life-span of seventy two years, 
Umbaradatt will die and reincarnate as an infernal being in the first hell named 
Ratnaprabha. From there he will follow the cycles of rebirths as mentioned in the first 
chapter in context of Mrigaputra... and so on up to... will be born millions of times in all 
hells, as all animals, and as all one sensed beings. 
Coming out from there, he will be born as a cock in Hastinapur city. After being 
killed by some evil persons, he will reincarnate as a son in a merchant family of the 
same Hastinapur city. There he will gain righteousness (samyaktva). From there he will 
reincarnate in the first heaven named Saudharm Devlok. Descending from there he will 
take birth in Mahavideh area and follow ascetic conduct immaculately. At last he will get 
enlightened and attain status of Siddha shedding all his karmas and ending all misery.

Φ INTRODUCTION:-- 
This eighth chapter describes a particular violent profession and its bitter fruits. It is 
more relevant in modern times. The central theme of this chapter is to describe the bitter 
fruits of sale and consumption of meat. Shriyak the cook killed or arranged to get killed a 
variety of animals and birds and prepared food for his master, the king. He too ate that 
food. As a result of this violence inspiring karma-programming he takes rebirth as 
Shaurikadatt Fisherman. He becomes a big fish-merchant. In order to catch fish he even 
poisons and dries ponds and lakes. 
This way, employing extremely cruel means, he indulges in fish-trading. He 
develops an insatiable craving for non-vegetarian diet. He suffers bitter fruits of this act 
during this life and continues to suffer miserable consequences for many future births. 
This explicates that not only the meat eater but also the cook, the seller, and the 
provider of meat is equally responsible for the violence involved.

(Jambu Swami asked—""Bhante I what is the text and meaning of the eighth chapter of Duhkha-
vipaak as preached by Shraman Bhagavan Mahavir?) Sudharma Swami Replied- 
Jambu I During that period of time there was a city named Shaurikapur. Outside 
this town was a garden named Shaurikavatansak, in which was a temple of Shaurik 
Yaksh. In that city ruled a king named Shaurikadatt. 
There was a settlement of fishermen in the northeastern direction outside 
Shaurikapur City. A fisherman named Samudradatt lived there. He was irreligious... and 
so on up to... enjoyed evil deeds only. He had a wife named Samudradatta. They had a 
son named Shaurikadatt whose body was fully and perfectly endowed. 
During that period of time Shraman Bhagavan Mahavir arrived (at Shaurika 
vatansak garden). People and the king came to attend his discourse. They returned 
home after the discourse. 
During that period of time, while returning after collecting alms from houses of high, 
low and medium castes in Shaurikapur city, for breaking his two-day fast, Bhagavan 
Gautam, the chief disciple of Shraman Bhagavan Mahavir, came to the main road (as 
mentioned earlier). While passing by that settlement of fishermen he saw in the middle of a 
crowd a hungry, emaciated and lean skeleton-like person clad in blue. His bones crackled

when he sat or stood up. On account of a fish-bone being stuck in his throat he was 
uttering piercing, pathetic, and plaintive sounds and words. He was vomiting and the vomit 
contained shreds of coagulated pus, blood and worms. Looking at his pathetic condition 
Bhagavan Gautam Swami thoughtfully contemplated—""Oh! This man is suffering infernal 
agony due to the sinful karmas he acquired due to evil deeds committed in the past."" With 
these thoughts he returned and asked Shraman Bhagavan Mahavir about the past birth of 
that person. In reply Bhagavan said— 
Gautam I During that period of time there was a city called Nandipur in 
Bharatvarsh area in Jambu continent. A king named Mitra was the ruler of that city. King 
Mitra had a cook named Shriyak who was irreligious... and so on up to!.. Enjoyed evil 
deeds only. 
That Shriyak cook had many assistants including—matsyiks (fishermen), vaguriks 
(animal trappers), and shakuniks (bird catchers). They used to kill small and soft as well as 
larger fish; goats... and so on up to... buffaloes; and partridges... and so on up to... 
peacocks and bring them to Shriyak cook. Many more partridges... and so on up to... 
peacocks were kept in cages. Shriyak cook also had many other employees, working on 
wages and food, who used to pluck out feathers of live partridges... and so on up to... 
peacocks and give him the bare bodies. 
Then that Shriyak cook used to chop the meat of numerous terrestrial, aquatic, and 
avian beings into small pieces, round pieces, long pieces, and short pieces. Some of these he 
cooked with ice; some he just stored separately to get seasoned naturally; some he left in the 
sun; and some he cooked in hot air or steam. Some of these pieces he cooked black and others 
brown. Some of these pieces he seasoned with buttermilk, some with hog-plum juice, some 
with grape juice, some with wood-apple juice, some with pomegranate juice, and some with fish 
juice. After this he fried some in oil, roasted some in fire, and grilled some on sticks (shulaprot). 
In the same way he also prepared soups froin meat of fish, deer, partridge,... and so on 
up to... peacock. He also prepared salad of a variety of vegetables. After arranging all these 
dishes properly he took them to the dining place of king Mitra and offered to the king. Shriyak 
cook too frequently enjoyed the so cooked, roasted and grilled meat and soup of numerous 
terrestrial, aquatic, and avian beings with vegetables and six kinds of wine. 
That Shriyak cook was ever involved in these sinful activities. These activities had 
become his way and ideal of life and he had accepted all these sinful activities to be the best 
conduct. As a consequence he acquired extremely malevolent and pain causing karmas 
in abundance. After completing his life-span of thirty three hundred years he died and 
reincarnated as an infernal being in the sixth hell. 
Samudradatta (wife of fisherman) was a jatunandika. Her offspring died at birth. 
Like Gangadatta, she also had idea while thinking about 'familymatters around midnight. 
After seeking permission from her husband she sought boon from Shaurik Yaksh and 
got pregnant. After satisfying her dohad (pregnancy-desire) she gave birth to a son. In 
due course the parents named the child—""As this child was born as a favour by Shaurik 
Yaksh he should be named Shaurikadatt."" And child Shaurikadatt began to grow up in 
care of five nursemaids. Crossing his adolescence he attained youth and maturity.

Some time later Samudradatt Fisherman died. Crying, wailing and weeping 
Shaurikadatt took the dead body to cremation ground in a funeral procession joined by 
many friends, kinfolk, and family members. There last rites and other formal rituals were 
performed. After this Shaurikadatt became the chief of the fishermen. Now he was a 
fisherman who had become irreligious... and so on up to... enjoyed evil deeds only. 
That Shriyak cook had employed many assistants, working on wages and food, 
which used to enter the great river Yamuna in small boats. They used to move around, 
scoop (hrid-galan), contaminate (hrid-malan), agitate (hrid-mardan), churn (hrid-manthan), 
drain (hrid-vahan) and discharge (hrid-pravahan) the river water in order to terrify and 
displace fish to facilitate hauling the same. Besides this they used a variety of means 
and equipment including prapanchul, prapampul, and matsyapuchchha. jrimbha, trisara, 
bhisara, visara, dvisara, hilliri, jhilliri, lalliri, jaal, gal, kootapash, valkal-bandh, sutra-
bandh, and baal-bandh (these are names of different types and designs of fishing nets). Thus 
they caught small and soft... and so on up to... large and stout fish and filled their boats. 
With haul they returned to the river-bank, unloaded it in a heap, and left it to dry in sun. 
Many other employees, working on wages and food, fried, roasted, grilled this 
sun-dried fish-meat in order to earn their living by selling same on roadside. Shaurika 
datt too frequently enjoyed cooked roasted and grilled fish-meat with six kinds of wine. 
At a certain time while eating the cooked roasted and grilled fish-meat, a fish bone 
got stuck in Shaurikadatt Fisherman's throat causing excruciating pain to him. Tormented 
by this, Shaurikadatt called his servants and instructed, ""Beloved of gods! Go and make 
this announcement loudly at every corner, crossings where three, four or more roads 
meet, main road and streets in Shaurikapur City—`0 Beloved of gods! Shaurikadatt has a 
fish bone stuck in his throat. Any Vaidya (qualified Ayurvedic doctor) and junior Vaidya, 
senior and junior Jnayak (those who learned and practiced the art of healing through their own 
experience), and senior and junior Chikitsak (those who practiced medicine and surgery) who 
is able to remove this fish bone will be amply and richly rewarded by Shaurikadatt.' The 
servants made the announcement as told. 
Hearing and understanding this announcement many healers (etc.) came to the 
residence of Shaurikadatt. They did the diagnosis by employing their four kinds of 
wisdom, namely—autpattiki buddhi (intuitive wisdom), vainayiki buddhi (acquired 
wisdom), karmaja buddhi (practical wisdom), and parinamiki buddhi (deductive wisdom). 
Then they tried their best to give relief to Shaurikadatt by making efforts to remove the 
fish bone by using various procedures, such as—making him vomit, by giving him 
expectorants (chhardan), by giving massage or compression (avapidan), by placing 
wooden pieces between molars to force open the mouth (kavalagraha), by using 
surgical instruments (shalyoddhar), and by applying medicines. But they failed to remove 
the fish bone from Shaurikadatt's throat and stop the flow of blood and pus. When these 
healers got exhausted (shraant), confused or mentally tired (cant), and disappointed 
(paritant) they returned from where they came. 
Disappointed with the treatment given by the healers and suffering excruciating 
and intolerable pain, Shaurikadatt has become emaciated and has been reduced to a 
mere skeleton. He spends his time in misery.

Φ INTRODUCTION:-- 
This ninth chapter contains the horrifying story of a cruel woman. The preceding 
chapter contained the description of a callous male characters who killed and tortured 
animals, birds, and fish; but this chapter describes a female character who mercilessly kills 
her own mother-in-law. In her earlier birth she was king Simhasen, a male. Instigated by 
his chief queen he imprisons the mothers of his other four hundred wives in a camouflaged 
house through deception and then burns them alive while they were asleep. The 
perpetrator of such cruel deed dies with cruel attitude and reincarnates as girl Devadatta. 
Although endowed with physical beauty, Devadatta had a perverted, ugly, and despicable 
mind. For her unrestricted enjoyment of mundane pleasures she mercilessly killed the 
mother of his husband, a devotee of his mother. 
Reading or listening to the grave consequences of such cruel deeds makes one 
shiver, and abhor violence.

Jambu During that period of time there was a city named Rohitak. Outside this 
town was a garden named Prithvi-avatansak in which there was a temple of Dharan 
Yaksh. In that city ruled a king named Vaishramanadatt. The name of his queen was 
Shridevi and that of his son, who was the crown prince, was Pushpanandi. 
In that Rohitak city lived a merchant named Datt Gathapati who was very rich 
and respected. The name of his wife was Krishnashri. Datt Gathapati and Krishnashri 
had a daughter named Devadatta who was perfectly endowed and beautiful. 
During that period of time Shraman Bhagavan Mahavir arrived at Prithvi-avatansak 
garden. Bhagavan gave his discourse to all, after which the king and the people returned 
home. During that period of time, while returning after collecting alms in the city, Gautam 
Swami, the senior disciple of Shraman Bhagavan Mahavir, came to the main road. There 
he saw many elephants, horses and foot soldiers duly equipped with armours and 
weapons. Amongst them he saw a woman, with her ears and nose cut off, tied in the 
avakotak bond (bending the neck and tying it with hands already tied at the back) and impaled 
on the gallows. (Oil was smeared on her body. On her hands and waist she wore the garb of a 
person sentenced to death. She was handcuffed and wore garland of red flowers on her neck. 
Her body was also smeared with chalk.) Gautam Swami thought that this woman was, 
indeed, suffering infernal agony. 
After collecting alms he left the city, came to Bhagavan Mahavir and asked—
""Bhante! Who was this woman in her last birth? In reply Bhaga van said— 
Gautam! During that period of time there was a prosperous city called 
Supratishth in Bharatvarsh area in Jambu continent. A majestic king named Mahasen 
was the ruler of that city. He had one thousand queens including Dharini in the inner 
quarters of his palace. King Mahasen and queen Dharini had a perfectly endowed and 
handsome son named Simhasen who was made the crown prince. 
At a certain time the parents got constructed five hundred large and exclusive 
mansions for prince Simhasen (when he attained youth). After this prince Simhasen was 
married to five hundred beautiful princesses including Shyama in a single day. Each of 
these brides were given sets of five hundred things in gold, silver (etc.) in dowry. He 
lived happily in lofty mansions enjoying all these gifts with the five hundred princesses 
including Shyama. 
After some time king Mahasen died. Prince Simhasen performed the last rites 
including cremation and ascended the throne. 
Then that king Simhasen, highly enamoured of Shyama Devi, spent his time 
madly engrossed in her thoughts and without caring for orhonouring other queens. On 
the contrary he spent his time happily neglecting and forgetting them all. 
Then the mothers of these four hundred ninety nine queens came to know of the 
fact that—`King Simhasen, highly enamoured of Shyama Devi, spent his time madly 
engrossed in her thoughts without caring or honouring their daughters. On the contrary 
he spent his time happily neglecting and forgetting them all.' On getting aware of this, 
they jointly decided that it would be to their benefit to somehow kill Shyama Devi by

means of fire, poison, or weapons. With this thought they awaited the opportunity to find 
her alone and murder her. 
Somehow Shyama Devi got to know of this conspiracy. When aware of all this, 
she thought—""The mothers of my four hundred ninety nine co-wives have come to 
know of the fact that—`King Simhasen, highly enamoured of Shyama Devi, spent his 
time madly engrossed in her thoughts without caring for our daughters. On the contrary 
he completely neglects them all. Therefore, it would be to our benefit to somehow kill 
Shyama Devi by means of fire, poison, or weapons.' With this thought they look forward to 
an opportunity to find me alone and murder me. In this situation I do not know when, how 
and what wretched death they will deal me."" These thoughts made her afraid, terrified, 
and agitated. Every part of her body trembled with fear and she came to copebhavan 
(the roon where an angry and displeased person spends time). There she spent her time 
brooding gloomily in a state of mental turmoil swinging between hop and despair. 
. When king Simhasen got the information about Shyama Devi's condition, he at 
once came to Shyama Devi in the copebhavan. Seeing her hapless and brooding 
gloomily in a state of mental turmoil swinging between hope and despair, he asked- 
""Beloved of gods ! Why are you so worried and heart-broken?” 
Seething in anger, like boiling milk, Shyama Devi responded with angry words-  
""My lord! On being aware of the fact (that you are infatuated with me), the mothers of 
my four hundred ninety nine co-wives met at a place and deliberated—Infatuated with 
Shyama Devi, king Simhasen does not respect our daughters. On the contrary he 
completely neglects them all. Therefore, it would be to our benefit to somehow kill 
Shyama Devi by means of fire, poison, or weapons.' Accordingly they await the 
opportunity to find me alone when you are not present and I am without any protection. 
My lord! I do not know what wretched death they will deal me. Terrified by this I came to 
the copebhavan (the room where an angry and displeased person spends time) and started 
brooding gloomily."" 
King Simhasen reassured Shyama Devi—""Beloved of gods ! Stop brooding 
gloomily in a hapless state of despair. I will certainly make arrangements to the effect 
that you are not caused even slightest of physical discomfort, pain or harm. 
Consoling and reassuring Shyama Devi thus, with loving and sweat words, king 
Simhasen returned. He then called his servants and instructed—""Go outside 
Supratishth city and construct a large kootakarashala (camouflaged house) with hundreds 
of pillars, which is very beautiful, charming, attractive and fit to be a queen's residence. 
Those servants left after raising their joined palms to their heads and humbly 
accepting the king's order. Going in the northeastern direction outside Supratishth city, 
they constructed a large and beautiful kootakarashala with hundreds of pillars. Once 
that was done they informed king Simhasen about desired kootakarashala being ready. 
Then at an opportune moment king Simhasen invited the mothers of those four 
hundred ninety nine queens. Getting king Simhasen's invitation, those mothers of the queens 
got ready embellished fully with dresses and ornaments according to their respective 
status and came to king Simhasen in Supratishth city. King Simhasen provided them 
lodging in the said kootakarashala.

Then king Simhasen called his servants and said—Take large quantities of 
ashan, paan, khadya, svadya (staple food, liquids, general food, and savoury food), flowers, 
dresses, fragrant garlands, and ornaments to the Kootakarashala. 
According to the king's order the servants took all these things there. 
Then those four hundred ninety nine mothers of queens embellished themselves 
with all kinds of ornaments and started enjoying that abundant food and wines as well as 
music and dance (by musicians and dancers). In other words, got engrossed in enjoying 
food, wines, dance and music. 
Around midnight king Simhasen came to the kootakarashala with many 
attendants. He got all the gates of the kootakarashala closed and then set it ablaze from 
all directions. 
Set afire by king Simhasen those four hundred ninety nine mothers of queens 
failed to find any shelter or protection. They died crying, wailing, and sobbing in despair. 
Ever involved in such sinful activities, accepting these activities to be ideal of life 
and the best conduct, king Simhasen acquired extremely malevolent and pain causing 
karmas in abundance. After completing his life-span of three thousand four hundred 
years, he died and reincarnated as an infernal being in the sixth hell where the 
maximum life span is twenty two Sagaropam. The soul that was king Simhasen, coming 
out of the hell, was conceived as a daughter in the womb of Krishnashri, the wife of Datt 
Sarthavaha in this Rohitak city. 
After nine months of pregnancy, that Krishnashri gave birth to a daughter. That 
girl was very delicate and beautiful. On the twelfth day after birth, the parents arranged 
for abundant food and invited their friends, relatives and kinfolk. After the feast they 
performed the naming ceremony—""Our daughter is hereby named Devadatta."" And girl 
Devadatta began to grow up in care of five nursemaids. 
In due course girl Devadatta crossed her adolescence and became a beautiful, 
charming, and well proportioned young woman. 
One day, after taking her bath and adorning herself with a variety of ornaments, 
Devadatta, surrounded by numerous maids including hunchbacks, was playing on the 
rooftop of her mansion with a golden ball. 
Around that time, after taking his bath, adorning himself with ornaments (etc.), 
surrounded by many attendants, and mounted on a horse, king Vaishramanadatt was going 
for horse-riding. He passed in the vicinity of Datt Gathapati's mansion. All of a sudden king 
Vaishramanadatt saw Devadatta playing with a golden ball. He was astonished at the 
beauty, charm and youth of Devadatta. He summoned his attendants and asked—""Beloved 
of gods ! Whose daughter is this ? What is her name?” 
The attendants joined their palms and informed—""Sire! This beautiful, charming, 
and well proportioned young woman is Devadatta, the daughter of Datt Gathapati and 
Krishnashri."" 
On his return from horse-riding, king Vaishramanadatt summoned his officials of 
confidence and said— 
 
""Beloved of gods! Please go and seek the hand of Devadatta, the daughter of

Datt Gathapati and Krishnashri, in marriage for crown prince Pushyanandi. She is worth 
getting even in exchange of our kingdom. (In other words, she is acceptable even if she 
wants to be the chief queen of the kingdom.) 
The officials formally joined their palms and humbly and happily accepted king 
Vaishramanadatt's order. After taking their bath and putting on their best court dresses 
they went to Datt Sarthavaha's mansion. Datt Sarthavaha was pleased to see them 
coming. He got up from his seat and went ahead seven-eight steps to welcome them. 
After greeting them he offered them suitable seats. When the officials took there seats and 
made themselves comfortable Datt Sarthavaha asked, ""Beloved of gods ! Tell me what 
gives me the honour of your visit?” 
On being asked thus by Datt Sarthavaha; the king's officials said, ""Beloved of gods ! 
We have come to seek the hand of your and Krishnashri's daughter Devadatta in marriage 
for our crown prince. Beloved of gods! If you feel that the match is seemly, appropriate, 
desirable, commendable and worth a union, please give your consent to marry Krishnashri 
to crown prince Pushyanandi. If you agree to our proposal please tell us the desired dowry?” 
On hearing the proposal from the king's officials Datt Sarthavaha replied, 
""Beloved of gods ! By asking the hand of my daughter kingVaishramanadatt has 
bestowed honour on me and, that is more than any dowry."" 
After this he sent them away after offering them food and honouring them with 
flowers, apparels, perfumes, garlands, and ornaments. messengers returned to king 
Vaishramanadatt and informed him aforesaid details (about the acceptance of proposal). 
 (After getting this information from the king's officials) On an auspicious tithi (date of the 
lunar calendar), karan (a division of the day, there being eleven in number including balav), 
divas (auspicious day), nakshatra (lunar mansion), and muhurta (moment) Datt Sarthavaha 
got plenty of ashan, paan, khadya, svadya (staple food, liquids, general food, and savoury 
food) ready. He then invited his friends, kinfolk, family members, near and far relatives 
and other people. After performing auspicious rituals including putting mark on his 
forehead, he took a comfortable seat and enjoyed that food with the guests. Having done 
that he sat at a place to wash his mouth and face clean. He then honoured friends, kin 
folk, family members, near and far relatives and other people with liberal gifts of flowers, 
garlands, perfumes, dresses, ornaments (etc.). 
After this he got his daughter adorned with a variety of ornaments, when she had 
taken her bath, and seated her in a palanquin lifted by one thousand persons. Carrying 
all kinds of gifts and accompanied by all his friends and relatives, he moved in a 
procession with all pomp and show including dance and music. Crossing Rohitak City 
he arrived at king Vaishramanadatt's palace and greeted him by joining his palms. 
There he presented his daughter before king Vaishramanadatt. 
When king Vaishramanadatt saw Devadatta as a bride he was very pleased. Then 
he got plenty of ashan, paan, khadya, svadya (staple food, liquids, general food, and 
savoury food) ready. He then invited his friends, kinfolk, family members, near and far 
relatives and other people and offered them food. After the feast he honoured them with 
liberal gifts of flowers, garlands, perfumes, dresses, ornaments (etc.). Having done that he 
seated prince Pushyanandi and bride Devadatta on a platform anointing them with water

poured from gold and silver urns. The bridal couple was then adorned with beautiful 
dresses and ornaments. Offerings were made into the sacred fire and the ritual of the 
bridegroom accepting the hand of the bride (panigrahan) was performed. At last with all 
grandeur, music and dance, rich gifts (dresses and ornaments) and exchange of greetings 
the marriage-ritual of prince Pushyanandi and Devadatta was ceremoniouslyperformed. 
After the marriage ceremony king Vaishramanadatt liberally offered food and gifts 
(dresses, perfumes, garlands, ornaments etc.) to Devadatta's parents and their family 
members, relatives and friends and bade themfarewell. 
Then in his exclusive palace prince Pushyanandi along with merchant's daughter 
Devadatta passed his time seeing, listening to, and enjoying sweet music of a variety of 
musical instruments including drums, thirtytwo kinds of dramas, other such performances 
and all other human comforts and pleasures. 
After some time king Vaishramanadatt died. On his death grief stricken Pushya-
nandi performed his last rites and other formal ritual with state honour. After the 
mourning Pushyanandi ascended the throw From crown prince he became the king. 
King Pushyanandi was greatly devoted to his mother Shridevi Every morning he 
would go to mother Shridevi, wherever she was, any touch her feet. Then he would get 
her body massaged with shatpaak and sahasrapaak medicated and perfumed oils and pastes 
(made with mixtures of one hundred and one thousand herbs). He would also give her comfort and 
relaxation through four types of body-massage--bone stimulating, muscle stimulating, skin 
stimulating, and hair stimulating. After that he would get her body cleansed by applying and 
rubbing perfumed powders. Then he would let her bathe with three kinds of water—lukewarm, 
cold, and fragrant. Once all this was done he would offer her enough food of four kinds. He would 
take his bath and food only after Shridevi had taken her bath, performed auspicious rituals, eaten 
her food, washed her mouth and face and reclined on her seat. Then he would commence his 
other daily activities including enjoying human comforts and pleasures. 
Once around midnight, engrossed in family problems, Devadatta thought""King 
Pushyanandi is very much devoted to his mother Shridevi and spends all his time taking her 
care. This distraction does not allow me to enjoy human comforts and conjugal pleasures with 
king Pushyanandi fully and to the desired extant. Therefore, it is better that I kill Shridevi 
somehow by means of fire, weapon, poison, or mantra and enjoy human comforts and 
conjugal pleasures with king Pushyanandi fully and to my entire satisfaction."" With these 
thoughts she looked forward to an opportunity to kill Shridevi when the king did not visit, 
when no other royal person was there and when even an ordinary person was also not 
there (she was absolutely alone). 
Once after her bath Shridevi was sleeping comfortably in her bed alone and in 
solitude. Availing the opportunity, Devadatta came to the room and found Shridevi sleeping 
comfortably in her bed. She looked around to ensure that no one was there to see her. 
Then she went to the kitchen, picked up an iron rod and heated it. When it was red hot like 
Kirnshuk flower (Butea frondosa) and fire she picked it with a pair of tongs and came where 
Shridevi was sleeping. Here she thrust the red hot iron rod into Shridevi's anus. With a 
terrible pathetic shriek Shridevi died.

Hearing the terrible shriek Shridevi's maids rushed to her room and saw Devadatta 
leaving. The maids came to Shridevi's bed and found her lifeless, still and dead. After 
seeing this they went to king Pushyanandi crying and wailing, and sobbing—""Oh ! Oh ! 
Alas ! Great misfortune has befallen us."" They informed king Pushyanandi—""Sire ! 
Queen Devadatta has killed mother Shridevi."" 
Hearing and understanding what the maids told him, king Pushyanandi, grief 
stricken due to the loss of his mother, fell on the ground like an axed Champak tree. 
After some time king Pushyanandi regained his consciousness and composure. In the 
company of many kings... and so on up to... caravan chiefs, friends and relatives he wept, 
wailed and sobbed loudly. Sobbing thus he performed the last rites of Shridevi with all state 
honour. Having done all this his anger surfaced with great intensity, giving him a terrifying look. 
Gnashing his teeth he got Devadatta caught by guards. He thensentenced her to death—
""She is to be taken to gallows and killed."" (As you have seen.) 
Thus, Gautam! Devadatta! Suffers the fruits of the extremely bad karmas 
acquired in the past. 
 (Hearing these details) Gautam Swami asked—""Bhante! After her death where will 
this Devadatta go? Where will she be reborn? 
Bhagavan replied—Gautam! After completing her life-span of eighty years, 
Devadatta will die and reincarnate as an infernal being in the first hell named 
Ratnaprabha. From there she will follow the cycles of rebirths as mentioned in the first 
chapter in context of Mrigaputra... and so on up to... will be born millions of times in all 
hells, as all animals, and as all plants including the bitter ones. Coming out from there she-
will be born as a swan in Gangapur city. After being killed by some bird catchers she will 
reincarnate as a son in a merchant family of the same Gangapur city. There he will gain 
righteousness (samyaktva). From there he will reincarnate in the first heaven named 
Saudharm Devlok. Descending from there he will take birth in Mahavideh area and follow 
ascetic conduct immaculately. At last he will get enlightened and attain the status of 
Siddha, shedding all his karmas and ending all misery.

[34] Meaning- The foreword of the eighth chapter should be read as before. 
(Jambu Swami asked—""Bhante! When this is the text and meaning of the ninth chapter, what is 
the text and meaning of the tenth chapter of Duhkha-vipaak as preached by Shraman Bhagavan 
Mahavir?) Sudharma Swami Replied- 
Jambu! During that period of time there was a city named Vardhamanapur. 
Outside this town was a garden named Vijayavardhan in which was a temple of 
Manibhadra Yaksh. In that city ruled a king named Vijayamitra. In Vardhamanapur city 
lived a merchant named Dhanadev Gathapati who was very rich and respected. The 
name of his wife was Priyangu. They had a daughter named Anju who was perfectly 
endowed and beautiful. During that period of time Shraman Bhagavan Mahavir arrived 
at Vijayavardhan garden. People came and Bhagavan gave his discourse to all after 
which the masses returned home. 
During that period of time, while going to collect alms, Gautam Swami, the senior 
disciple of Shraman Bhagavan Mahavir, was passing in the vicinity of the garden outside the 
palace of king Vijayamitra. There he saw a woman who was lean, famished, emaciated 
(devoid of flesh), producing rattling sound (having rattling skeleton), and so weak and cadaverous 
that her bones appeared to be covered with skin alone. She wore a blue dress and was 
uttering distressful, pathetic and plaintive sounds and words. Seeing this pathetic scene 
Gautam Swami thought—""Why she is suffering such infernal agony?"" He came to Bhagavan 
Mahavir and asked-""Bhante! Who was this woman in her last birth? In reply Bhagavan said- 
Gautam! During that period of time there was a prosperous city called Indrapur in 
Bharatvarsh area in Jambu continent. A king named Indradatt was ruler of that city. In 
that city lived a courtesan named Prithvishri (description to be read as that of Kamadhvaja 
courtesan). In Indrapur city that Prithvishri courtesan enticed many kings... and so on up 
to... caravan chiefs by means of her beauty, gestures, display of body-parts, and her art. 
Where she failed, she used magical powers and powders for seduction. She spent her 
time enjoying all human and carnal pleasures fully and as she desired. 
Considering this kind of acts to be her duty, giving importance to, being well 
versed in, and being engrossed in such deeds that Prithvishri courtesan (due to lechery) 
continued to accumulate intense malevolent karmas. Completing her life span of three 
thousand five hundred years she died and took rebirth as an infernal being in the sixth 
hell with a maximum life span of twenty two Sagaropam. 
On leaving the second hell, her soul was conceived as a daughter in the womb of 
Priyangu, the wife of Dhanadev Sarthavaha in this Vardhamanapur city. On completion 
of nine months Priyangu gave birth to a daughter who was named Anjushri. All other 
details should be read as in case of Devadatta. 
Once while king Vijayamitra was going for horse-riding he saw the beauty and 
charm of Anjushri. He was attracted to her like king Vaishramanadatt. He then sought 
her hand in marriage like minister Tetaliputra (JnataDharmaKatha Sutra)... and so on up 
to... He married Anjushri and lived happily in his palace. 
Once queen Anjushri was afflicted with acute vaginal pain. When king Vijaya came 
to know of this he called his attendants and said—""Beloved of gods! Go and make this 
announcement loudly at every corner, crossings where three, four or more roads meet,

main road and streets in Vardhamanapur City that queen Anjushri is suffering from acute 
vaginal pain. Any Vaidya (qualified Ayurvedic doctor) and junior Vaidya, senior and junior 
Jnayak (those who learned and practiced the art of healing through their own experience), and 
senior and junior Chikitsak (those who practiced medicine and surgery) who is able to cure that 
diseases will be amply and richly rewarded by king Vijayamitra. 
The servants made the announcement as told. 
Hearing this announcement by the state officials many healers (etc.) came to 
king Vijayamitra. They did the diagnosis by employing their four kinds of wisdom, 
namely—autpattiki buddhi (intuitive wisdom), vainayiki buddhi (acquired wisdom), karmaja 
buddhi (practical wisdom), and parinamiki buddhi (deductive wisdom). Then they tried their 
best to cure ailing Anjushri by using various procedures. However, they failed to do so. 
When these healers got exhausted (shraant), confused or mentally tired (taut), and 
disappointed (paritant) they returned from where they came. 
Suffering from that excruciating vaginal pain, queen Anjushri went lean, 
famished, emaciated (devoid of flesh), and cadaverous. She spent her time in this state 
uttering distressful, pathetic and plaintive sounds and words. 
Bhagavan added- Thus, Gautam! Anju! Suffers the fruits of the extremely 
bad karmas acquired in the past (as you have seen). 
 (Hearing these details) Gautam Swami asked- ""Bhante! After his death where will 
this Anju go? Where will she be reborn?” 
Bhagavan replied—Gautam! After completing her life-span of ninety years, Anju will 
die and reincarnate as an infernal being in the first hell named Ratnaprabha. From there 
she will follow the cycles of rebirth as mentioned in the first chapter in context of 
Mrigaputra... and so on up to... will be born millions of times in all hells, as all animals, and 
as all plants. Coming out from there she will be born as a peacock in Sarvatobhadra city. 
After being killed by some hunters she will reincarnate as a son in a merchant family of the 
same Sarvatobhadra city. There he will gain righteousness (samyaktva). From there he will 
reincarnate in the first heaven named Saudharm Devlok. 
Gautam—""Bhante! After completing the life and state of Devlok where will that 
soul go? Where will he be born?” 
Jambu! Descending from there he will take birth in Mahavideh area and follow 
ascetic conduct immaculately. At last he will get enlightened and attain the status of 
Siddha shedding all his karmas and ending all misery. 
Sudharma Swami concluded, ""Jambu Shraman Bhagavan Mahavir, who has 
attained nirvana, has narrated this text and meaning of the tenth chapter of Duhkha-
vipaak. So I state."" 
Jambu- ""Bhante! What you say is, indeed, true. What you said is a fact.""

****                                                                                                                            
 
There is an all pervading truth in Bhagavan Mahavir's sermon—All good or bad 
karmas acquired by beings, essentially bear fruits. Bad karmas acquired through 
violence, falsity, stealing, lechery, greed, and other base attitudes and indulgences 
always bear bad and painful fruits. Austerities, detachment, discipline (self-control),         
charity, service and other noble attitudes and indulgences cause acquisition of good 
karmas that always bear good and happiness causing fruits. 
In the two parts of this Agam Vipaak Shrut—Duhkha-vipaak and Sukha-vipaak—
Bhagavan Mahavir has established the aforesaid statement and elaborated it with, 
examples. 
In this world darkness emphasizes the importance of light. In the same way sorrow 
emphasizes the importance of happiness. Because sorrow exists, a being gets afraid of it 
and desires for happiness, endeavours for availing happiness. Because death exists, a 
being searches for immortality to avoid death. That is the reason that in this Agam, Vipaak 
Shrut, the fruits of good and bad karmas have been revealed. It first of all states hair

--►SHRUTSKANDH - 2 ◄-- 
The ten chapters of Duhkha-vipaak have stories that inspire us to avoid 
violence, falsity, corruption and other such evil activities by vividly describing 
their terrible consequences. The desire for happiness is inherent within the wish 
to be rid of sorrows. The basic source of happiness is acquisition of good karmas 
which in turn is done through dharma (righteousness and piety). That is the reason 
for the belief that dharma is the source of happiness. 
Four kinds of dharma have been mentioned in the scriptures—daan (charity), 
sheel (morality), tap (austerity), and bhaavana (pious attitude). Of these the first path 
is charity. Most important among the ten kinds of charity is dharma-daan (pious 
charity). One of the limbs of pious charity is supatra dawn (charity to the deserving). 
This specifically means 'to offer pure things or services with noble feelings to the 
lofty individuals who have renounced the world and are practicing austerities'. The 
greatness of this charity is unparalleled. As a result of such charity many people 
have gained happiness, good fortune, and wealth as well as an opportunity to lead 
a pious and righteous life. In the ten chapters of this Sukha-vipaak the glory of 
pious charity been elaborated. These ten chapters present lively examples of the 
extant of happiness and good fortune gained through charity. 
Of these the first chapter is titled Subahu Kumar. This person gained so 
much beauty, charm, popularity, wealth, happiness and good luck in life that 
astonished even a great sage and spiritualist like Ganadhar Gautam. So much so 
that he asked about its reason from Bhagavan Mahavir. Throwing light on the 
source of Subahu Kumar's happiness and good luck, Bhagavan provided 
inspiration for every pious soul to follow the path of dharma. This, indeed, is the 
message of Sukha-vipaak Shrut. 
 
 
 
[35] Meaning- During that period of time there was a city called Rajagriha near 
which was a chaitya named Gunasheelak. Ganadhar Arya Sudharma Swami arrived 
there. Jambu Swami, involved in his service, asked—""Bhante! When Shraman Bhagavan 
Mahavir, who has attained liberation, has preached the aforesaid text and meaning of 
Duhkha-vipaak then what according to him is the text and meaning of Sukha-vipaak?” 
In reply Sudharma Swami said—""Jambu Shraman Bhagavan Mahavir has 
preached ten chapters of Sukha-vipaak. They are—

Arya Sudharma replied---- Jambu! During that period of time there was a large 
city named Hastishirsha. It was rich, prosperous and secured with respect to buildings, 
wealth, trade and governance. 
In the north-eastern direction (Ishan Kone) outside this city was a garden named 
Pushpakarandak having trees bearing all season flowers and fruits. In that garden there 
was a temple of Kritavanamalapriya Yaksh. It was beautiful and very popular. 
That city was ruled by king Adeenashatru who was highly influential among 
kings. He had one thousand queens in his inner palace. Chief among them was queen 
Dharini Devi. 
Once while sleeping in her regal palace, Dharini Devi saw a lion in her dream. The 
story of the birth, of Subahu should be read as that of Meghakumar mentioned in 
Jnatadharmakathanga Sutra. (So should be read the. description of his birth ceremony, education, etc.). 
Subahu Kumar attained youth and became capable of enjoying worldly and carnal pleasures. 
When his parents realized that Subahu Kumar had become proficient in seventy 
two arts and had attained desired maturity to enjoy all the pleasures of life, they got 
constructed five hundred Prasadavatamsak (most exclusive, as the crown is among 
ornaments) palaces, which were lofty, grand, and beautiful. In the middle of these palaces 
he got constructed a gigantic palace. Like Mahabala, Subahu Kumar was also married. 
The unique thing about Subahu Kumar's marriage was that he was married to five 
hundred very beautiful princesses in one day. Following the same tradition, the parents 
gave five hundred sets of things as dowry. (These gifts included exclusive ornaments, 
garments, and other large and small household things.) Subahu Kumar resided in these 
beautiful palaces that reverberated with sound of drums and music as well as dramas. He 
lived happily enjoying all human pleasures and comforts. 
 During that period of time Shraman Bhagavan Mahavir arrived in Hastishirsha 
city. People of the city came to attend his discourse. Like king Kunik, king Adeenashatru 
also came out to pay homage and attend the discourse with great pomp and show. Like 
Jamali Kumar, Subahu Kumar also went to pay homage to Bhaga van riding a chariot. 
Bhagavan gave his sermon, after which the king and the people dispersed. 
Listening to and contemplating on the discourse of Shraman Bhagavan Mahavir, 
that Subahu Kumar was very happy. Subahu Kumar stood up and, after paying homage 
and obeisance, said—""Bhante! I have faith in the word of the Nirgranth (one who is free 
of all knots, inner and outer). At your pious feet many kings, influential and rich persons 
(ishvar)... and so on up to... and caravan chiefs (sarthavaha) have been initiated into the 
Anagar Dharma (the religion of the homeless ascetics;Jain religion) after renouncing their 
households and tonsuring their heads. In other words, they have accepted the code of five 
great vows (PanchMahaurat). But I am not capable enough to renounce my household, 
tonsure my head and embrace asceticism. Therefore I want to accept the householder's 
code (Grihasth Dharma) of twelve vows including five minor vows (Anuvrats) and seven 
instructive or complimentary vows of spiritual discipline (Shikshavrats). 
Bhagavan said—""Beloved of gods! Do as you please and avoid languor when 
doing a good deed.""

Then Subahu Kumar accepted the householder's code (Grihasth Dharma) of 
twelve vows including five minor vows (Anuvrats) and seven instructive or complimentary 
vows of spiritual discipline (Shikshavrats) before Bhagavan. After that he returned home 
riding his chariot. 
During that period of time Indrabhuti Gautam Anagar, the senior disciple of 
Shraman Bhagavan Mahavir asked—""Bhante ! This Subahu Kumar is beloved (of all) 
having lovable appearance, attractive having attractive appearance, adorable having 
adorable appearance, enchanting having enchanting appearance, serene having 
serene appearance, good-looking, and pretty. Bhante ! To many people and even 
ascetics he appears to be beloved... and so on up to... and pretty. 
""Bhante! How this Prince Subahu Kumar got and availed this human opulence? 
How it appeared before him? [What was his name and caste? In which village or 
settlement was he born? What charity, indulgence, blend and dry food, conduct (ascetic 
or householder's) and the sermon of which Shraman or Brahmin has helped him attain 
this opulence? Has he been blessed with this or acquired himself? What is the cause of 
his acquiring and enjoying this?] 
Commentary- The author of this Agam has used fourteen adjectives including isht 
and ishtaroop to describe Subahu Kumar. He has mentioned further that to many people and 
even ascetics he -ppears to be beloved... and so on up to... and pretty.' This last statement 
emphasizes his proficiency in art of living. Some people gain popularity through their social 
service, charity and congenial speech and behavior. Their morality and social behaviour are 
excellent but they are not so successful in their religious and spiritual life. They lag behind in 
the practice of detachment, austerities, vows and self-control. Some people have ideal 
religious life but they are inept in their social life. Only a person with equal excellence and 
lofty ideals in every facet of life including religion and ethics, service of the self and others, 
detachment and indulgence is popular among masses as well as sages. A great sage, 
hermit, and yogi like Gautam Swami was so pleased and impressed with the social 
behaviour and religious conduct of Subahu Kumar that he presented his curiosity before 
Bhagavan. This indicates that Subahu Kumar must have had a unique personality. The 
aphorism under reference states fourteen adjectives in this regard. These words appear to 
be synonyms but, in fact, they vary in their nuances and connotations. On the basis of the 
elaborations by AbhayadevSuri, commentator (Tikakaar) explained these terms as follows--  
- Isht (adorable)—One whose behaviour and action is congenial for all, who is 
liked and adored by all is called isht. 
-Isht-roop—Adoration 
may 
be 
due 
to 
some 
specific 
work 
oraccomplishment of a person. But isht-roop is a person having adorable appearance. 
-Kaant—Adorable appearance could also be for many reasons. But at the same 
time, he was desirable (kaant) as well. 
-Kaant roop—He was good natured. (By  good nature of Subahu, he was adorable.) 
-Priya—In spite of loving nature a person can fail in invoking love. But one who 
inspires love is priya (beloved). 
Priya roop—one whose appearance inspires love is priya roop (lovable).

-Manojna and manojna roop—whose inner feelings or attitudesmake him appear 
beautiful is called manojna (beautiful). One having that appearance is manojna roop. 
-Manom and manom roop—the quality of being manojna (beautiful) could be 
momentary and transitory. The adjective manom indicates its permanence. The quality 
that inspires a profound and memorable experience of beauty makes a person manom. 
What leaves a lasting imprint of beautiful appearance is manom roop. 
-Soma—A person devoid of rage or anger, whose face and eyes are serene and 
happy, and whose looks inspire peace in others is soma. One with serene nature is 
soma coop. 
-Subhag—auspicious; beholding whom enhances good luck. 
-Suroop—whose appearance is pretty and nature is friendly. 
-Priyadarshan—love inspiring; one whose mere look invokes love. 
Laddha, patta, and abhisamannagaya—explaining the difference in the meaning 
and purport of these three terms it has been mentioned that—to inherit wealth earned by 
ancestors is labdh (laddha); to earn wealth through one's own efforts is prapt (patta); and 
to enjoy the labdh I prapt wealth is abhisamnvagat (abhisamannagaya). These adjectives 
subtly convey the kshayopasham (extinction-cum-pacification) of labhantaraya (gain 
hindering) and bhogantaraya (enjoyment hindering) karmas. 
Meaning- (On being asked by Gautam, narrating the story of previous birth of Subahu 
Kumar Shraman Bhagavan Mahavir said—) ""Gautam! During that period of time there was 
a prosperous city called Hastinapur in Bharatvarsh area in Jambu continent. A rich 
merchant named Sumukh lived there. 
During that period of time Dharmaghosh Sthavir (senior ascetic) was living. He 
belonged to a prominent jati (maternal caste) and kula (paternal caste). Wandering from 
one village to another, along with his five hundred disciples, he arrived at the 
Sahasramravan garden in Hastinapur city. After seeking formal permission he camped 
there and commenced enkindling his soul with discipline and austerities. 
During that period of time Dharmaghosh Sthavir had a disciple named Sudatt 
ascetic. He observed noble conduct. He had ingested Tejoleshya after toning it down 
(Tejoleshya being the firepower acquired through rigorous austerities and having intensity to 
burn things in a wide range of many Yojans within a moment). He was observing a series of 
month-long fasts interspersed with a day of meals. On the day of fast-breaking, that 
Sudatt ascetic spent first quarter of the day in studies and second quarter of the day in 
meditation. During the third quarter, like Gautam Swami had sought Bhagavan 
Mahavir's permission to go to seek alms, he sought Dharmaghosh Sthavir's permission 
to go to seek alms. After that, wandering around he entered the house of Sumukh 
Gathapati to seek alms. 
When Sumukh Gathapati saw Sudatt ascetic approaching, he was pleased and 
delighted. He rose from his seat, stepped on the foot-rest and got down. He then put off 
his slippers and took an ekashatika (a long scarf-like non-stitched piece of cloth, also called 
uttariya). He placed this uttariya on his shoulders (for covering his mouth). As a mark of 
respect, he took seven to eight steps ahead to greet Sudatt ascetic. He then went 
around the ascetic three times clockwise and paid him homage and obeisance. After

*****                                                                                                                                    
this he proceeded to his kitchen. He was overjoyed with the idea of getting the 
opportunity to give ample food as alms to the visiting ascetic. He was pleased at the 
time of giving charity as well as after giving charity. 
By giving three-way-pure charity (pure food, pure seeker, pure donor) through three-
way-pure means (natural altruism, simplicity, and purity of mind, speech and body) to Sudatt 
ascetic (in other words, by giving pure food as alms with pious feelings to Suddatt ascetic) 
Sumukh Gathapati was overwhelmed with joy. Through this pious deed he considerably 
reduced the extant of the cycles of rebirth and acquired the bondage of karrnas 
responsible for a birth as a human being. Five divine things appeared in his house—(1) 
Shower of gold, (2) shower of flowers of five colours, (3) falling of clothes, (4) sounding 
of divine drums, and (5) divine pronouncement of Ahodanam' (great charity). 
On the crossing of three roads... and so on up to... and streets people gathered 
and talked to each other—""Beloved of gods ! Blessed is Sumukh Gathapati! His life has 
become meaningful."" 
Commentary—while donating, a sentimental and guileless donor experiences 
joy three times—(1) the first instance of joy comes with the thought, 'I will donate today. 
I am fortunate to get the golden opportunity of giving charity today.' (2) The second 
instance is when every pore of his body is filled with joy during the act of giving. (3) And 
the third instance is when his joy and contentment continues to enhance with the 
remembrance of the act of donating. 
Trividh-shuddhi (three-way-purity)—(1) Deya shuddha—pure food or alms. (2) Data 
shuddha—pure donor; sincere and guileless donor. (3) Patra shuddha—pure seeker, such 
as a detached Shraman. When a donation has such three-way-purity or triple purity it 
becomes cause of breaking bonds of karmas and reducing  extant of the cycles of rebirth. 
Appearance of five divine things indicates that the charity was so ideal and lofty that 
gods effected showers of gold (etc.) in order to commend and popularize the act. (1) Divine 
shower of gold is called vasudhara. (2) Shower of flowers of five colours—black, blue or 
green, yellow, white and red. As these divine flowers are created through the power of 
transmutation or transformation, they are lifeless (achit). (3) Chelotkshep—chela means 
clothes and uileshep means throwing. There is a shower of clothes from the sky, (4) 
Sounding of divine drums. (5) Divine pronouncement of Ahodanam' (great charity). An 
astonishing charity is called Ahodanam. When a charityattracts gods and forces them to 
exdaim—Ahodanam' (Great charity!), it is, indeed, a great charity. 
Meaning- Then that Sumukh Gathapati enjoyed a long life of hundreds of years. 
After his death at the destined moment he descended as a son into the womb of Dharini 
Devi, the consort of king Adeenashatru of Hastishirsha city. Queen Dharini Devi saw a lion 
in her dream in her state of partial slumber. Other details have already been stated. This 
way he is fully enjoying the human pleasures and comforts in his lofty mansions. 
Bhagavan added—Gautam! As a consequence of the aforesaid great charity 
Subahu Kumar availed and acquired this human opulence.                                        .
 
After listening to the story of the past birth of Subahu Kumar Gautam Swami 
asked—""Bhante! Is Subahu Kumar capable of getting initiated by you into ascetic 
religion by renouncing his household and tonsuring his head?”

Bhagavan- ""Yes, Gautam! He is capable of getting initiated."" 
Bhagavan Gautam paid homage and obeisance and resumed enkindling his soul 
with discipline and austerities. 
Some 
time 
later 
Shraman 
Bhagavan 
Mahavir 
left 
the 
temple 
of 
Kritavanamalapriya Yaksh in Pushpakarandak garden in Hastishirsha city and resumed 
his wanderings in other states. 
Here that Subahu Kumar became a Shramanopasak (a devotee of ascetics). He 
acquired the knowledge of fundamentals including being (soul) and non-being (matter). 
He spent his time availing every opportunity of donation to the deserving. 
Observing the vows of a shravak (Jain layman), Subahu Kumar used to go to the 
paushadhashala (place for observing partial ascetic vow or paushadh-vrat) on every auspicious 
day of a fortnight—fourteenth, eighth, fifteenth (both dark or amavasya and bright or purnima). 
There he would properly inspect and clean (pramarjan) the paushadhashala and inspect 
the place for disposing excreta. He would then make a bed of hay, sit on it and take the 
vow of a three day fast (avoiding eight meals or ashtam-bhakt). Having taken the partial 
ascetic vow (paushadh-vrat) and observing a three day fast he would remain awake and 
alert absorbed in spiritual contemplation. 
Once while absorbed in spiritual contemplation during his partial ascetic vow a 
thought surfaced in his mind— 
Blessed are those villages, cities, and settlements where Shraman Bhagavan 
Mahavir visits. 
Also blessed are those kings, nobles (etc.) who, in presence of Shraman 
Bhagavan Mahavir, get initiated after tonsuring their heads. 
Also blessed are those kings, nobles (etc.) who, in presence of Shraman 
Bhagavan Mahavir, accept the householder's code (Grihasth Dharma) of twelve vows 
including five minor vows (Anuvrats) and seven instructive or complimentary vows of 
spiritual discipline (Shikshavrats). 
Also blessed are those kings, nobles (etc.) who listen to the sermon of Shraman 
Bhagavan Mahavir. 
Therefore, in case, wandering from one village to another, Shraman Bhagavan 
Mahavir arrives here; I will also renounce my home and get initiated in his presence 
after tonsuring my head. 
Commentary—the 
number 
of 
adjectives 
used 
with 
Subahu 
Kumar's 
contemplation is six. They are—(1) Ajjhatthiye—surfacing of thoughts from the depths of 
soul. (2) Kappiye—to reach the heights of imagination. (3) Chintiye—repeated surfacing 
of the same idea in mind. (4) Patthiye—to wish and pray again and again for a specific 
thing. (5) Manogaye—the idea that is still in mind and not expressed in words. (6) 
Sankappe--crystallization of an idea into a resolve. 
According to Yogashastra when a person fully concentrates on his thoughts, his 
breath, feelings, and life force flows through the Sushumna (the channel of the spinal 
cord). In that state the thought or resolve materializes soon.

Meaning- Shraman Bhagavan Mahavir became aware of Subahu Kumar's 
resolve. Wandering from one village to another he arrived at the temple of 
Kritavanamalapriya Yaksh in Pushpakarandak garden in Hastishirsha city. Following the 
ascetic norms he sought for a suitable place of stay and commenced enkindling his soul 
with discipline and austerities. 
On getting the news of Bhagavan's arrival people of the city and the king came to 
pay their homage. Subahu Kumar also came ceremoniously to Bhagavan (like Jamali). 
Bhagavan gave his sermon to the large gathering and Subahu Kumar. After which the king 
and the people dispersed. 
Subahu Kumar listened to the sermon by Shraman Bhagavan Mahavir. While 
contemplating over it he got detached and sought permission from his parents to get 
initiated as an ascetic, as Megh Kumar, King Shrenik's son, did. On getting permission his 
pre-renouncing lustration was performed like that of Megh Kumar... and so on up to... He 
became an ascetic, observed the codes of Irya samiti (care of movement)... and so on up 
to... he became completely celibate. 
He studied all the eleven Angas (canons) including Samayik from the senior 
ascetics of Shraman Bhagavan Mahavir's order. Enkindling his soul by observing 
numerous austerities including fasting for one, two, three, and more days, he 
immaculately followed the ascetic code for many years. In the end he took the ultimate 
vow (sallekhana) of one month duration. At the conclusion of the month long fast 
(avoiding sixty meals) at the destined moment of death he embraced meditational death 
after doing critical review (pratikraman). He reincarnated as a god in the Saudharma kalp 
(a dimension of gods). 
Completing the age, state and life by ayukshaya (shedding the life span determining 
karma particles), bhavakshaya (shedding the divine state determining karma particles), and 
sthitikshaya (shedding the karma particles determining the extant of life span), the soul that was 
Subahu Kumar will abandon his divine body and reincarnate as a human being. He will get 
enlightened. Then after tonsuring his head, will get initiated as an ascetic by sthavirs 
(senior ascetics). Following the ascetic code for many years he will embrace meditational 
death after doing critical review (pratikraman). He will reincarnate as a god in the 
Sanatkumar kalp (the third heaven). 
From there he will again reincarnate as a human being. After getting initiated 
(etc.) he will reincarnate in the Mahashukra Devlok (divine dimension). Descending from 
there .he will again take birth as a human being and get initiated as before. Then he will 
reincarnate in the ninth Devlok called Anat. Completing the state and life there, he will 
again take birth as a human being and get initiated as before. Then he will reincarnate 
in the eleventh Devlok called Aran. Descending from there he will once again 
reincarnate as a human being, get initiated and after death reincarnate in the 
Sarvarthsiddha Viman. Descending from there the soul that is Subahu Kumar will at 
once take rebirth as a human being in one of the wealthy families in Mahavideh area. 
He will get initiated like Dridhapratijna Kumar and attain the status of a Siddha.

[38] Meaning- The foreword of the second chapter should be read as before. 
(Jambu Swami asked—""Bhante ! What is the text and meaning of the second 
chapter as preached by Shraman Bhagavan Mahavir ?"" Sudharma Swami replied—) 
Jambu! During that period of time there was a city named Rishabhapur. It had a 
garden named Stupakarandak. In it was a temple of Dhanya Yaksh. That city was ruled 
by king Dhanaavaha. His queen was named Saraswati Devi. The dream of the queen, 
telling the king about the dream, birth of a son, growing of the child, education, maturing, 
marriage, dowry, and enjoying pleasures in lofty mansions, all these details should be 
read as those about Subahu Kumar (Chapter-1). 
The only difference being that the name is Bhadranandi Kumar instead of Subahu 
Kumar and he was married to five hundred girls, chief among them being Shridevi. 
Bhagavan Mahavir arrived. Bhadranandi accepted Shravak Dharma (householder's code). 
On being asked by Gautam about his past birth, Bhagavan Mahavir replied— 
(In past birth) He was a prince named Vijaya in Pundarikini city in Mahavideh 
area. Vijaya gave alms donation to Tirthankar Yugabahu and as a consequence 
acquired Ayushya karma (life span determining karma) to be a human being. Completing 
his life span there, he has reincarnated as Bhadranandi. All these details should be read 
as those about Subahu Kumar... and so on up to... He will take rebirth in Mahavideh 
area and at last will become Siddha (perfect), Buddha (enlightened), Mukta (liberated) and 
attain nirvana ending all misery.

Jambu! During that period of time there was a city named Saket. It had a garden 
named Uttarakuru. In that garden was a temple of Paashamriga Yaksh. That city was 
ruled by king Mitranandi. His queen was Shrikanta. They had a son named Varadatt 
Kumar. He was married to five hundred girls, chief among them being Varasena. 
Bhagavan Mahavir arrived. Prince Varadatt accepted Shravak Dharma (householder's 
code). On being asked by Gautam about his past birth, Bhagavan Mahavir replied-- 
(In past birth) There was a city named Shatadvar. King Vimalavahan ruled there. 
He saw ascetic Dharmaruchi coming and with great devotion he offered faultless food 
as alms to the ascetic. As a consequence acquired Ayushya karma (life span deter-
mining karma) to be a human being. Completing his life span there, he has reincarnated 
as Varadatt the son of King Mitranandi and queen Shrikanta. 
Remaining details should be read as those about Subahu Kumar. Like—After 
Bhagavan's departure he went to paushadhashala and observed fasts. Considered those 
who got initiated in presence of Bhagavan to be lucky. Resolved to get initiated when 
Bhagavan visited again. All thesedetails are similar both for Subahu Kumar and Varadatt 
Kumar. Then after getting initiated and observing ascetic code he will move alternatively 
from human dimension to divine dimension and so on. Then like Subahu Kumar he will 
take rebirth in Mahavideh area and at last will become Siddha (perfect), Buddha 
(enlightened), Mukta (liberated) and attain nirvana ending all misery like Dradhpratijna. 
Sudharma Swami concluded, Jambu Bhagavan Mahavir, who has attained nirvana, 
has narrated this text and meaning of tenth chapter of Sukha-vipaak. So I state. 
Jambu-""Bhante! What you say is, indeed, true. What you said is a fact."" 
 
 
Φ Meaning- Duhkha-vipaak has ten chapters that are to be finished in ten days. 
Same is true for Sukha-vipaak; remaining details should be read as in AcharangaSutra.

◙ Something about This Publication ◙ 
 
 
We have already published 45 Aagams in Four languages Prakrut, Sanskrut 
(Satik), Hindi and Gujarati.  Now a day for new generation & abroad living people, 
English translation has become a necessity.  So we have planned to translate or 
compile Jain-Aagam in English. We gave priority to Nandi Sootra because it’s 
known as wellbeing & auspicious sootra. The Theme of Nandi is knowledge; 
Nandi-sootra mainly describes five types of “ान-(Jnanas)”.  
 
After that we have started Niraayavalika panchak, from that panchak, 
here we are giving meaning with commentary of Nirayaavalika. 
 
Narayaavalika is an “Ang-bahya”Aagam, at present it is known as “Upang” 
Sootra. Shree Chandra-Suri has written Vrutti [commentary] on Nirayaavalika. 
 
Here, we have compiled Translation done by Surendra Bothara, which is 
originally edited in to Hindi by Shree Am ar-Muni & Shree Chandra Surana, We 
have  two motives for publishing this book.—[1] To provide Aagam literature in 
English & [2] It should be given in Microsoft Word format so people can do Cut, 
Paste & Editing by themselves also. 
 
At present this Book is published as a Net-Publication with the help of the 
Jain Education International organization of America.  In future we may publish it 
as a Book also. We are also planning to put more Aagams in English before you. 
 
We also invite learned persons to translate more & more ‘authentic Jain 
literature   ’ in English for kids and youths, so the ignorant-people of regional 
languages can also read or learn our “Shashtra & Granth”. 
 
We are very much thankful to Shree Pravinbhai, Sudeshbhai, Late Mr. 
Krupal Shah and all other known-unknown persons who helpd us for this project 
directly or indirectly.

Introduction:- 
 
This work bearing the title Nirayaavalika Sutra is in fact an anthology of five 
Upangas (the auxiliary explanatory works to the twelve Angas or the main corpus of the 
Jain canonical texts) which is called Upanga. The names of these Upangas are (1) 
Kappiya (Kalpika) also known as Nirayaavalika, (2) Kappavadinsiya(Kalpavatansika),    
(3) Pupphiya(Pushpika), (4) Pupphachuliya (Pushp-chulika) and (5) Vanhidasa 
(Vrishnidasha).  
They have already been discussed in detail in the preface. First of these is 
Nirayaavalika, the Upanga of the eighth Anga, Antakriddasha Sutra. The following 
Upangas are also connected with one Anga each. The first Upanga, Nirayaavalika is 
also known as Kappiya. As it contains description of ten prominent characters 
destined to be born in infernal worlds (Narak) it became more popular as 
Nirayaavalika  
This Upanga has ten chapters. The story is about ten sons (including Kaal Kumar), 
of Emperor Shrenik, the famous sovereign of the Magadh empire and a contemporary of 
Bhagavan Mahavir. The detailed story of Shrenik, Kunik, Kaal Kumar, and others. The 
famous Rath-musal battle has been included in this chapter. 
 
 
 
[1] Meaning - During that period of time (in the fourth epoch of the time cycle 
when Bhagavan Mahavir was living) there was a city called Rajagriha. It was endowed 
with prosperity, agricultural wealth, glory, prosperity, and grandeur. On its north-east 
direction was Gunasheelak Chaitya where there was a large slab of rock placed under 
a huge Ashoka tree. [For detailed description see Aupapaatik Sutra.  
Commentary- Aupapaatik Sutra contains a beautiful and comprehensive 
description of Champa city, the garden outside the city, Ashoka tree, slab of rock, etc. Here 
the description about Rajagriha city and its surroundings should be taken to be the same. 
[2] Meaning - During that period of time Shraman Bhagavan Mahavir's disciple 
Arya Sudharma Anagaar was living. He belonged to a prominent family and caste 
and had other attributes like Keshi Kumar Shraman. Wandering comfortably from one 
village to another, along with his five hundred disciples, he arrived in the town of 
Rajagriha... and so on up to... after seeking formal permission he camped there 
enkindling his soul with spiritual activities related to inner discipline and 
austerities.Throngs of people visited (his place of stay). Sudharma Swami 
gave a discourse and the masses returned home. (details should be read

 ***** 
[3] Meaning- During that period of time Arya Sudharma Anagaar had an ascetic 
disciple named Jambu Anagaar. The structure of his body conformed to samachaturasra 
sansthan (the anatomical structure of a human being where parallel lines drawn from the 
extremities of a body sitting cross-legged form a square and where all the parts of body above and 
below the navel are of standard dimensions. The dimensions increase and decrease 
proportionately). He was endowed with vipul tejoleshya (great radiant energy), which gave 
him a highly radiant appearance. He sat before Arya Sudharma Anagaar at a suitable 
place not very far, in a proper posture suitable for meditation, and with rapt attention. 
[4] Meaning- A curiosity sparked in the mind of ascetic Jambu Swami. He 
modestly bowed before Sudharma Swami and respectfully put forth his question— 
""Bhante ! What is the text and meaning of the Upangas given by Shraman Bhagavan 
Mahavir, who has attained the eternal abode of the Siddha-state ?"" 
Sudharma Swami replied, ""Long lived Jarnbu ! Shraman Bhagavan Mahavir 
has preached the five sections of Upangas as follows—(1) Niryaavalika, (2) 
Kalpavatansika, (3) Pushpika, (4) Pushp-chulika, and (5) Vrushnidasha."" 
[5] Meaning- ""Bhante ! If there are five sections of Upangas, Niryavalika... 
and so on up to... Vrushnidasha as given by Shraman Bhagavan Mahavir, who has 
attained the eternal abode of the Siddha-state [Mox], how many chapters are there in 
the first section of the Upangas - Niryavalika, as narrated by Shraman Bhagavan 
Mahavir ?"" 
Sudharma Swami replied ""Jambu ! Shraman Bhagavan Mahavir has stated ten 
chapters of Niryaavalika, the first section of the Upangas. They are—(1) Kaal, (2) Sukaal, 
(3) Mahakaal, (4) Krishna, (5) Sukrishna, (6) Mahakrishna, (7) Virakrishna, (8) 
Ramakrishna, (9) Pitrasen-krishna, and (10) Mahasen-krishna. (Each title bears the name of 
a prince.) 
Bhante ! If there are ten chapters in Niryaavalika, the first section of the Upangas, 
as given by Shraman Bhagavan Mahavir who has attained the eternal abode of the 
Siddha-state(Mox), what is text and meaning of first chapter of Niryaavalika, 
the first section of Upangas, as given by Shraman Bhagavan Mahavir ?"" 
Sudharma Swami replied ""Jambu ! During that period of time there was a 
city called Champa in Bharatavarsh area in this continent called Jambudveep. It 
was full of large mansions (etc.), was free of fears from within and outside, and 
was rich in wealth and grains. Outside this city in the north-east direction (Ishan 
Kone) was a garden called Purnabhadra. In this garden there was an ancient 
temple of Purnabhadra Yaksha. [For description of the Purnabhadra Chaitya, See- 
Aupapaatik Sutra] 
That Champa city was ruled by a great and glorious king named Kunik, the 
son of King Shrenik and Queen Chelana. [For description of King Kunik, See- 
Aupapaatik Sutra] 
The consort of King Kunik was queen Padmavati Devi, who was extremely 
delicate and beautiful. She was much adored by Kunik (... and so on up to...) and 
enjoyed life.Also in Champa city lived Kaali Devi, wife of King Shrenik and a step 
mother of King Kunik. She too had delicate limbs and was very beautiful.  
[6] Meaning- Kaali Devi had a son named Kaal Kumar. He was also delicate 
and handsome. [The commentator (Tikakaar) advises to consider the description of Kaal 
Kumar to be same as that of Megh Kumar in Jnatadharma katha Sutra]  
At some later period,  Kaal Kumar with his strong army,  consisting of  3000

***** 
elephants, three thousand chariots, three thousand horses and thirty million soldiers 
joined King Kunik, the owner of the eleventh part of the empire, in the Rath-musal 
battle in Garud Vyuha (eagle shaped battle formation) (fought against King Chetak).  
[7] Meaning- One day while thinking about the condition of her family, 
Kaali Devi was plagued by an apprehension—""My son, Kaal Kumar has gone 
with his three thousand horses... and so on up to... in the Rath-musal battle. Will 
he win or not? Will he live or not? Will I be able to see Kaal Kumar alive or not?"" 
With these thoughts she became dejected and started worrying. 
Around that time Shraman Bhagavan Mahavir's samavasaran (divine 
assembly) was held in Champa city. Throngs of people came there to pay homage 
and attend the discourse. 
Kaali Devi was happy to get this news. She thought—""Wandering from one 
place to another Shraman Bhagavan Mahavir has arrived in Champa city. His arrival 
is certainly a good omen. What to say of the benefits of going near him and paying 
homage, mere hearing of his name is highly bountiful. Unlimited is the importance of 
learning the elaborate meaning of the canon from him. Therefore, I will go to behold 
him, worship him and enquire of him about my son ?"" 
With these thoughts Queen Kaali called her attendants and gave 
instructions—""Beloved of gods Bring at once the best of the chariots reserved for 
religious ventures duly ready and equipped with horse, driver, and other things."" 
The attendants prepared the chariot and brought it. They informed the queen 
of concluding the assignment given to them. 
Kaali Devi took her bath and performed other daily chores (like applying 
perfumed oils on the body, etc.). After that she adorned herself with costly, light weight 
and exclusive ornaments. She then came out of the palace accompanied by a large 
contingent of maids from many countries including hunchbacks (kubja), ... and so on up 
to... female-guards of inner quarters. Coming out of the palace she boarded that 
religious chariot and, surrounded by members of her family and friends, passing 
through Champa city arrived at Purnabhadra Chaitya. There she stopped the carriage 
and alighted from it. Surrounded by numerous maids (as mentioned) she approached 
the spot where Bhagavan Mahavir was seated. After this the queen went around 
Bhagavan three times and paid homage and obeisance. Now she stopped there and 
joining her palms commenced the worship with reverence and eagerness in order to 
listen to Bhagavan's discourse. 
After that Shraman Bhagavan Mahavir gave his discourse to the large congregation 
along with KaaliDevi. (See- description of discourse in Aupapaatik). Shramanopasaks and 
Shramanopasikas are firm in religious codes and are followers of the word of the Jina. 
Queen Kaali was happy, contented and delighted to listen to the sermon of 
Shraman Bhagavan Mahavir. She then paid homage and obeisance to Shraman 
Bhagavan three times and put forth her question—""Bhante ! My son, Kaal Kumar, has gone 
with his three thousand horses... and so on up to... in the Rath-musal battle. Will he win or 
not ?... and so on up to... Will I be able to see Kaal Kumar alive ?"" 
Bhagavan said in reply—""O Kaali ! Your son, Kaal Kumar, along with three 
thousand elephants (etc.) joined King Kunik in the Rath-musal battle. While fighting, 
wounding, trampling, and killing many soldiers and felling their banners and colours  
darkening the sky in all directions and smashing chariot with chariot he came across King 
Chetak (cheda Raja).

""When King Chetak saw Kaal Kumar approaching him, he was infuriated. 
Gnashing his teeth and pressing his lips, King Chetak raised his bow, loaded an arrow 
and drew the string to his ears. In just one shot he fatally wounded Kaal Kumar. 
Pierced with the arrow, Kaal Kumar fell on the ground like a broken peak of a hill and 
died on the spot. Therefore, 0 Kaali ! Kaal Kumar has met his death. You cannot see 
him alive now."" 
Commentary- Here AcharyaShri raised a question. Use of such hurtful language 
and expression is forbidden. Why then Bhagavan uttered such words? An explanation for 
this doubt- ""This is a statement by an Agam-knowing omniscient, who is well aware of the 
consequences of such language and expression. He knew that this incident was going to 
be the cause of Kaali Devi's detachment and would inspire her to get initiated to pursue 
spiritual beatitude. Thus it does not involve any transgression. 
0- Meaning- Hearing about this incident from Shraman Bhagavan Mahavir, Kaali 
Devi was struck with the grief of loss of her son. She fell and her whole body struck the 
ground like a Charnpak creeper cut with an axe. 
After some time (on being nursed by her maids) when she regained her compo-
sure, she got up and paid homage to Bhagavan. After paying homage she uttered—
""Bhante ! It is, indeed, so! So is the reality, Bhagavan !, Prabho ! It is the truth !, 
Bhagavan ! It is beyond any doubt, Bhante ! It is exactly as you say !"" With these words 
she once again paid homage and obeisance to Bhagavan. After that she rode her 
religious chariot and went in the direction she had come from. 
[8] Meaning- At that time Bhagavan Gautam approached Shraman Bhagavan 
Mahavir and addressing him as Bhante r , paid his homage and obeisance.After 
greeting thus and conveying his curiosity he said—""Bhante ! While fighting the Rath-
musal battle along with three thousand elephants (etc.),Kaal Kumar has met his 
death after being fatally wounded and getting  drenched in blood by just one shot of 
arrow by King Chetak.  
Where has he gone after death ? Where has he reincarnated ?"" 
Bhagavan replied to Gautam Swami—""Gautam ! Going to war with three 
thousand elephants, that Kaal Kumar has reincarnated after his death in the Hemabh 
Narak (name of a specific area in the infernal world)of the Pankaprabha Prithvi (the fourth 
hell) as a naarak (infernal being) among nairayiks (infernal beings) with a life span of 
ten Sagaropam (a metaphoric unit of time)."" 
[9] Meaning Gautam asked further—""Bhante! After indulging in what activities 
(related to sense organs of hearing etc.), enjoyments (related to intense infatuation), 
and activities-enjoyments; after committing what violence,sinful deeds, and violence-
sins; and under the weight of what bad karmas at the time of death; Kaal Kumar, 
after death, has incarnated as a nairayik  in the Pankaprabha Prithvi (the fourth hell)? 
 (In reply to this question, Bhagavan explained causes of t Rath-musal battle.)--- 
Gautam ! The reason for that is as follows— 
During that period of time (when this incident occured) there was a city called 
Rajagriha. It was endowed with wealth, grains, glory, prosperity, and grandeur. In that 
Rajagriha city ruled King Shrenik who was as majestic as the peak of the Himavan 
mountain). The consort of King Shrenik was queen Nanda, who was extremely delicate and 
beautiful (... and so on up to...) and enjoyed life. The son of king Shrenik and queen Nanda 
was prince  Abhaya Kumar. He was delicate and handsome.  He was as accomplished as

the renowned Chitt Charioteer in the four prongs of politics, namely saam (incantation), 
daam (bribery), bhed, (guile), and dand (threat)... and so on up to... He held the reigns of 
the state and was its well-wisher and astute governor. 
King Shrenik had another queen named Chelana. She was extremely delicate and 
beautiful (... and so on up to...) and enjoyed life. 
Once, free of all worries, queen Chelana was sleeping in a comfortable bed in her 
bedroom. Sometime during the night queen Chelana, like queen Prabhavati, saw a lion in 
her dream and woke up. Later, the king called dream interpreters and asked for the 
meaning of the dream. After they told the meaning of the dream they were greated with due 
honour. Accepting the words of the augurs happily, Queen Chelana returned to her 
quarters. (This conveys that Queen Chelana had become pregnant.) 
Commentary - Detailed description of the marriage of King Shrenik with Nanda, 
birth of Abhaya Kumar, his appointment as a minister and other incidents are included in 
the appendix. Details about Chitt Charioteer are available in Rayapaseniya Sutra, 
aphorism-206. The dream sequence of seeing a lion and other information is like the 
story of Mahabal Kumar in Bhagavati Sutra, Shatak 11, Uddeshak 11. Here mainly 
three reasons have been given for Kaal Kumar's passage to hell—extreme infatuation 
for mundane pleasures, deep involvement in extreme sins, extreme covetousness, 
including evil conduct. 
[10] Meaning On completion of three months of pregnancy Queen Chelana 
had a dohad (desire of a pregnant mother)—""Blessed, fortunate, and contented are 
those mothers who brown, fry, and roast on stick the meat from the belly of their 
husbands (Shrenik in this case) and enjoy tasting and eating arid sharing with their 
friends with a variety of wines, namely sura, madhu, merak, madya, seedhu, and 
prasanna. And thus fulfill their dohad."" 
As this base and hurtful dohad could not be fulfilled, Queen Chelana was in a 
state of mental agony. She became anemic, emaciated, and weak like a famished 
person. Signs of aging appeared on her body. She lost the natural freshness and glow, 
and the healthy pink of her face was replaced by a sick gloom. In this sad state she sat 
gazing at the earth. She became apathetic to any and all sorts of cosmetics and 
adornments including flowers, perfumes, garlands, and ornaments. Her face and body 
lost the natural freshness and glow, like a crushed garland of Champa flowers. Hurt 
due to her unfulfilled desire, she plunged into the sea of grief and misery. Sitting with 
chin placed in her palm she was overwhelmed by deep melancholy. 
Observing the dull, emaciated, and gloomy appearance of Queen Chelana her 
personal maids and attendants went to King Shrenik. Formally greeting him by placing 
their joined palms on their foreheads they said, ""Sire ! For some unknown reason today 
Queen Chelana is in an emaciated state of body and a gloomy state of mind."" 
Hearing this news from the maids King Shrenik was surprised. He became 
disturbed and worried. He immediately rushed to Queen Chelana. Seeing Queen 
Chelana in her emaciated state of body and gloomy state of mind, he asked, ""0 beloved 
of gods ! Why have you become so weak and sad ? 
Queen Chelana remained silent giving no heed to the inquiry by the king. 
King Shrenik repeated the question again but in vain. Third time also the king 
asked the same question adding—""O beloved of gods! Am I not fit to be your 
confidant? Is it the reason why you are not revealing cause of your sorrow to me?""

**** 
After being asked twice and thrice by King Shrenik, Queen Chelana broke her 
silence—""My Lord ! There is nothing that you are not fit to hear. Even this one you are not 
unfit to hear. In fact, it is this one that is not worth your attention. This is because, my lord ! 
almost three months after I saw the great dream, I got this dohad Blessed, fortunate, and 
contented are those mothers who brown, fry, and roast on stick the meat from the belly of 
their husbands... and so on up to... eating with a variety of wines. And thus fulfill their dohad  
As this dohad cannot be fulfilled I am getting emaciated, famished and gloomy."" 
Commentary- for this aphorism Acharya Shri writes—""This incident presents 
several inspiring and ideal things—                   (1) Duties of a wife towards her husband. 
(2) Irrespective of the kind of issue, there should be no mistrust or secrets between 
husband and wife. (3) This also indicates that Queen Chelana was averse to meat eating 
and was ashamed and sorry for her detestable craving caused by her state of pregnancy. 
O- Meaning - Hearing the aforesaid words from Queen Chelana, King Shrenik 
gave her assurance—""Beloved of gods ! Don't torture yourself by suppressing your 
desire. Rest assured that I will find a way to fulfill your dohad (desires of a pregnant 
mother)."" Thus he assured Queen Chelana in sympathetic, adorable, appealing, 
generous, beatific, commendable, pleasing, and inspiring voice and words. 
After that he left Queen Chelana. Leaving his palace, he entered the assembly hall 
and sat on his throne facing east. He started contemplating about the possible ways and 
means to fulfill this dohad. He applied his four types of wisdom (autpattiki or instantaneous 
one; vainayiki or acquired with modesty; kaarmiki or one gained through experience; and paarinamiki 
or enriched through imagination, logic, and age) and considered a variety of ways to achieve the 
desired goal. When he could not come up with any means, methods, or arrangements for 
some solution in spite of all his efforts, he became frustrated and worried. 
At that time Abhaya Kumar, getting ready after taking his bath and donning a 
beautiful dress and ornaments, left his palace. He came to the outer court (the assembly) 
where King Shrenik was sitting. When he found king despondent he inquired- ""Father ! In 
the past when you saw me coming you used to receive me affectionately (etc.). But what is 
the matter that you are sad and worried today? Father! If you find me worthy of knowing 
the cause of your worry, please tell me. Without any hesitation, doubt, or reservation 
kindly reveal the truth candidly so that I may seek the final solution to your problem."" 
King Shrenik replied—""Son ! There is nothing that cannot be told to ydu. Three 
months have passed since your step-mother, Queen Chelana saw that lion in her 
dream. She now has a dohad Blessed, fortunate, and contented are those mothers who 
brown, fry, and roast on stick the meat from the belly of their husbands. (etc.)' 
""As this dohad cannot be fulfilled, Queen Chelana is getting weak and worried. 
Son ! That is why, being unable to find ways and means to fulfill that dohad, I am 
disconcerted and worried."" 
When Abhaya Kumar heard about the problem from King Shrenik he assured the 
king, ""Father ! please get rid of your anxiety and do not lose hope. I will do something 
and shall ensure that my step-mother, Queen Chelana, is able to fulfill her Dohad .Thus 
he reassured King Shrenik in encouraging words. 
After reassuring King Shrenik, Abhaya Kumar returned to his palace. There 
he called his reliable and senior confidants and said—""Beloved of gods ! Go to an 
abattoir and get fresh flesh and blood (specifically the belly portion including intestines) 
filled in a bag."" 
Nirayaavalika-Upang-8- Chapter-1

**** 
Those confidants happily accepted Abhaya Kumar's command and left. They 
came to an abattoir and collected a bag filled with fresh flesh and blood including 
intestines. They returned to Abhaya Kumar and placed that bag before him. 
Abhaya Kumar cut a portion of the flesh with scissors and came where King 
Shrenik was sitting. (He explained to King Shrenik the secret plan and his role.) The king 
was then made to lie down flat on his back on a bed in privacy. The blood soaked flesh  
was placed on the kings exposed belly covering it with the entrails. It looked as if fresh 
blood was oozing from the belly. Queen Chelana was asked to sit in a high balcony 
overlooking the whole scene. The bed with King Shrenik lying flat was brought 
immediately under the balcony. Portions of King Shrenik's belly (false) were sliced with a 
knife and placed in a tray. King Shrenik acted as if he had fainted. Sometime later they 
both started talking. 
After sometime Abhaya Kumar took the tray with slices of flesh from King Shrenik's 
belly, brought it to Queen Chelana and placed it before her. 
Then Queen Chelana fulfilled her dohad with slices of flesh from King Shrenik's belly. 
This way Queen Chelana's dohad was fulfilled and she carried her fetus comfortably. 
Commentary- This indicates that in those days desires of women were duly 
respected. Specially, fulfillment of the desire of pregnant women was considered to be an 
essential duty by the men-folk. 
`This also indicates that meat was not cooked in King Shrenik's kitchen and everyone, 
including Queen Chelana despised this. That is why Abhaya Kumar had to do this act and 
Queen Chelana was filled with feelings of remorse and repentance for this misdeed. 
Suppressing her natural affection and maternal love, she later threw the newborn 
on a heap of trash as an act of atonement.' 
[11] Meaning- Some days later at midnight when, Queen Chelana was awake she 
was filled with this apprehension—""The moment this child came to my womb it ate the 
flesh from his father's belly. Therefore, it would be good for me to destroy, abort, dissolve, 
and disintegrate this fetus (as otherwise on being born and getting mature he could bring harm to 
his father and the family). She firmly resolved to do so. She then made all efforts to destroy 
abort, dissolve, and disintegrate the fetus by taking a variety of medicines prescribed for 
that. However, she failed to destroy, abort, dissolve, and disintegrate the fetus. 
When Queen Chelana failed to destroy... and so on up to... disintegrate the fetus 
with the help of a variety of medicines, she became tired, exhausted, disappointed, 
dejected, and sad. Then out of compulsion and in a distressed state of mind, she 
helplessly carried the fetus. 
[12] Meaning After nine months of pregnancy Queen Chelana gave birth to a 
delicate and beautiful child. 
After the delivery Queen Chelana was filled with this apprehension—""The moment 
this child came to my womb it ate the flesh from his father's belly. Therefore there are 
chances that on maturing he may end up being the scourge of the family. Therefore, it 
would be good for me to throw this infant on a heap of trash in isolation. Resolving thus 
she called a maid of her confidence and said—""Beloved of gods! Go and throw this infant 
on a heap of trash in isolation."" 
That reliable maid heard Queen Chelana's instructions and accepted them 
humbly by joining her palms. She then lifted the child in the cup of her joined palms. 
She proceeded to the garden and threw the child on a forlorn heap of trash.

**** 
When the child was thrown on a forlorn heap of trash the garden was filled 
with a glow. 
When King Shrenik got this news he rushed to the garden. When he saw the child 
lying on a forlorn heap of trash he turned red with anger. Burning with anger and 
gnashing his teeth, the king lifted the infant in his palms and came to the place where 
Queen Chelana was sitting. He scolded and reprimanded Queen Chelana in angry and 
harsh tone. After that he said—""Why did you manage to throw my son on a forlorn heap of 
trash ?"" After these contemptuous words he made her take an oath and said—"",Beloved of 
gods ! Bring up this child with due and proper care."" 
Hearing the harsh and contemptuous words from King Shrenik, Queen Chelana 
was ashamed of her deed. Like a humiliated wrong-doer she joined her palms and 
accepted King Shrenik's command humbly. She commenced bringing up and protecting 
the child taking due and proper care. 
[13] Meaning- When the child was thrown on a forlorn heap of trash a cock had 
pecked j the tip of his finger and injured it. Blood and pus were intermittently oozing from the 
wound. This made the child scream and wail with extreme agony. Hearing the wailing of 
the child and knowing the cause, King Shrenik used to come near the child and lift 
him. Then he would take the injured finger in his mouth, suck the blood and pus, and 
spit it out. This would give relief to the child and he would stop crying. This way 
whenever the child wailed, King Shrenik came near the child, lifted him, and sucked 
out the blood and pus. This gave relief to the child and he stopped crying. 
Later, on the third day (of the birth ceremonies) they performed the ritual ado 
rational beholding of the sun and the moon... and so on up to... On the twelfth day 
they performed the naming ceremony giving the child a virtue based name—""As the 
tip of the finger of this son of ours was cut by a cock when he was thrown on an 
isolated heap of trash his name should be Kunik (one with a cut finger)."" Thus the 
new-born was formally named Kunik by his parents. 
After this the traditional birth related ceremonies were concluded. As he grew 
Kunik enjoyed all comforts of life in the palace. He was married to eight princesses 
and his parents gave him marriage gifts in sets of eight. (all details as per the story of 
Megh Kumar in Jnata Dharma Katha Sutra) 
[14] Meaning- Once while awake around midnight prince Kunik thought—
""Due to interference and restrictions from King Shrenik it is impossible for me to 
enjoy the power and wealth of the kingdom as I desire. Therefore, to handcuff, 
shackle, and imprison King Shrenik and ascend the throne by crowning myself in an 
elaborate coronation ceremony would be to my benefit."" He turned the idea into a 
resolve and started looking for faults and lapses in the king's security and an 
opportunity to catch him unawares.  
As time passed he failed to either find faults and lapses in the king's security or any 
opportunity to catch him unawares. Then one day he invited ten princes (his ten brothers) 
including Kaal Kumar in his personal palace and took them into confidence—""Beloved of 
gods ! Due to interference and restrictions from King Shrenik we are being deprived of 
enjoying the power and wealth of the kingdom. Therefore, beloved of gods ! it would be to 
our benefit to handcuff, shackle, and imprison King Shrenik. After that we should divide the 
kingdom, state, army, carriers (elephants and horses), treasury, granaries and population in 
eleven parts and govern the people enjoying the wealth and grandeur of the state.""  
The ten princes including Kaal Kumar listened to  idea of Kunik and humbly accepted

the same. A few days later, at some opportune moment after knowing the secrets of King 
Shrenik, prince Kunik put Kin Shrenik in shackles (and put him in the prison). In an elaborate 
coronation ceremony he got himself crowned. Prince Kunik now became the king. 
One day after taking his bath, applying perfumes and auspicious mark (tilak), and 
wearing clean garb and ornaments suitable for the royalty, King Kunik came to Queen 
Chelana to touch her feet and pay homage. 
[15] Meaning- On this occasion he found mother Chelana sad, worried and 
melancholic. He at once touched Queen Chelana's feet and asked—""Mother! What is the 
matter? Today you do not appear contented, zealous, joyous or happy, even when I, your 
son, live happily enjoying the glory of the kingdom?"" (In other words, does my becoming king 
not please you?) 
Queen Chelana replied—""Son! How can I be contented, zealous, joyous or 
happy when you have ceremoniously ascended the throne by imprisoning your god-
like and guru-like father, King Shrenik, who has only love and affection for you?"" 
To these words of mother Chelana Kunik responded—""Mother! King Shrenik was 
desirous of destroying me. 0 mother! King Shrenik wanted to kill me or apprehend me and 
exile me from the state. 0 mother! How then do you say that he dearly loved me?” 
Hearing these words Queen Chelana said to prince Kunik—""Son ! On completion 
of three months after I conceived you I had this dohad—""Blessed, fortunate, and contented 
are those mothers who... and so on up to... with the help of my maids I threw you on a 
heap of trash... and so on up to... whenever you wailed, King Shrenik came near you and 
sucked out the blood and pus from your wounded finger. This gave you relief and you 
stopped crying."" Thus Queen Chelana narrated the aforesaid details to Kunik and added—
""That is the reason, why I told you that King Shrenik dearly loved you."" 
King Kunik heard this story about his past from Queen Chelana and thought about it. 
He then said—""Mother! Indeed, I have committed a grave mistake by shackling King 
Shrenik, my god-like and guru-like father who so profoundly loved me. Now I shall go and 
cut his shackles with my own hands."" With these words he picked up axe and left for prison. 
Commentary- This informs that prior to the said moment Kunik was not aware of all 
these details about the post birth incidents of his life. He was also angry because of the 
delay in his coronation. He considered his father to be his enemy because of some 
misunderstandings. Further, he was caught in the trap of greed for the kingdom. Besides, 
karrnas accumulated in the past births were also the inspiring factor for this.  
0- Meaning- King Shrenik saw prince Kunik approaching with an axe in his hand. 
The moment he saw this he thought—Prince Kunik, who considers misdeeds as his duty 
wishes to destroy me. He is shameless and devoid of any considerations of honour. He is 
coming this way with an axe in his hand. I do not know what contemptible death he will 
inflict on me."" Filled with fear, awe, apprehension, nervousness and horror, he put taalput-
vish (a deadly poison) in his mouth. 
Within a few moments of swallowing it the poison spread throughout the body of 
King Shrenik and it was rendered breathless, motionless, and lifeless. 
Prince Kunik reached the prison after this and found King Shrenik breathless, 
motionless, and lifeless. Whining with bereavement of losing his father and engulfed in grief, 
he fall on the ground like an axed champak tree. 
Sometime later, when prince Kunik regained some of his composure, he uttered, 
weeping and wailing in grief—""Alas ! I am a despicable, worthless, and unfortunate sinner.

I have committed an extremely evil deed by putting my god-like and loving father, King 
Shrenik in prison. My father, King Shrenik, died because of me. I am the singular cause of 
his death."" 
After that, weeping, wailing, mourning and moaning surrounded by luminaries 
including numerous chieftains, administrators, princes, knights of honour, landlords, village 
heads, family heads, businessmen, merchants, commanders, caravan chiefs, ambassadors, 
and diplomats he performed the last rites and cremation of King Shrenik ceremoniously and 
elaborately with due honour and respect. 
Deeply affected by this grief prince Kunik, loaded with funds and household 
equipment, left Rajagriha with his family and retinue and came to Champa city (in order to 
forget his sorrow). (This indicates that he shifted his capital from Rajagriha to Champa) 
Under the influence of mundane enjoyments and comforts of life, his grief and 
sorrow were consigned to oblivion in due course. 
[16] Meaning-  One day King Kunik invited his ten brothers including Kaal Kumar 
and divided the kingdom, state, army, carriers (elephants and horses), treasury, granaries, 
retinue and population into eleven parts. Taking charge of their individual shares all the 
brothers lived happily governing their respective people and enjoying the wealth and 
grandeur of their respective states."" 
[17] Meaning-  In Champa  city lived prince Vehalla, the younger brother of King Kunik 
and son of King Shrenik from Queen Chelana. He was charming and handsome. 
When King Shrenik was alive he had given the majestic elephant Sechanak 
and an eighteen string necklace to prince Vehalla. 
That prince Vehalla and his family used to ride Sechanak elephant and passing 
through the roads of Champa go to the banks of river Ganges. As a routine he would enter 
the river for taking his bath. During that period (of enjoying the bath) Sechanak elephant 
would lift the queens with its trunk, place one on its back, one on its shoulders, another on 
its neck and still another on its head. It would also put one of them on its tusks and swing 
one between tusks with its trunk. It would also shower water on some. Thus it played with 
them in many ways. 
Many citizens standing on the trisections, crossings and roads of Champa city 
(seeing the playful activity of prince Vehalla with Sechanak elephant) said, spoke, chatted, and 
criticized—""Beloved of gods ! This prince Vehalla, along with his family, enjoys various 
playful activities with Sechanak elephant. In fact it is prince Vehalla who is truly enjoying the 
pleasures and joys of the royal wealth. In spite of being the sovereign, King Kunik appears 
to be unable to enjoy the royal wealth to its fullest. 
Commentary- There is an inconsistency regarding the name Vehalla in the 
available scriptures. In this Niryaavalika Sutra the story of this battle is connected 
exclusively with prince Vehalla. In Niryaavalika Tika, Bhagavati Tika and many other 
books two names have been mentioned with this incident—Halla and Vihalla. 
In AnuttarAupapaatik Sutra Vihalla and Vehayas are shown as sons of 
Chelana and Dharini respectively. According to Niryavalika Tika and Bhagavati Tika 
both Halla and Vihalla were sons of Chelana. What is the reason for these 
discrepancies is a matter of research. 
0-Meaning- When Queen Padmavati heard these rumors prevailing among the 
citizens, she thought—""It is certain that prince Vehalla entertains himself by playful 
activities with Sechanak elephant. Thus it is, indeed, true that it is prince Vehalla and

not King Kunik who is truly enjoying the pleasures and joys of the royal wealth. 
Therefore, if we do not own that Sechanak elephant all this royal grandeur and large 
state we have is worthless. So I should convey this to King Kunik."" With these thoughts 
Queen Padmavati came to King Kunik and greeted him by touching her forehead with 
joined palms and hails of victory. She then said—""My lord! Your younger brother, prince 
Vehalla, enjoys life indulging in a variety of playful activities with Sechanak elephant. 
Therefore, of what use and worth is all this royal grandeur and large state if we do not 
own that Sechanak elephant?” 
King Kunik remained silent and gave no heed, importance or attention to what 
Queen Padmavati said. He acted as if he did not listen to it. Then Queen Padmavati 
started nagging the king repeating her statement timely and untimely. On being 
pressurized and nagged by Queen Padmavati, King Kunik one day called prince 
Vehalla and asked him to return Sechanak elephant and the eighteen string necklace. 
Prince Vehalla responded—""My lord ! King Shrenik had given me Sechanak 
elephant and the eighteen string necklace during his life time. If you want to take these 
please give me half of your kingdom and state. Then only I will give you Sechanak 
elephant and the eighteen string necklace. 
King Kunik did not accept prince Vehalla's demand. Attaching no 
importance to it he time and again put forth his demand for Sechanak Y elephant 
and the eighteen string necklace. 
On this repeated demand for Sechanak elephant and the eighteen stringnecklace, 
prince Vehalla thought—""The king wants to forcibly dispossess me of these two things. 
Therefore, before King Kunik confiscates Sechanak elephant and the eighteen string 
necklace I should leave Champa city with my family, household things, Sechanak 
elephant and the eighteen string necklace and elope to Vaishali city to take refuge with 
grandfather Chetak."" 
With these thoughts prince Vehalla waited looking for information about King 
Kunik's inner secrets, lapses in security and an opportunity to elope. 
One day when prince Vihalla knew of King Kunik's absence, he took the              
opportunity and stealthily left Champa city with his family, household things, Sechanak 
elephant and the eighteen string necklace. He came to Vaishali city, took refuge with 
his maternal grandfather Chetak and settled there. 
When King Kunik got the news that prince Vehalla with his family, household 
things, Sechanak elephant and the eighteen string necklace was living with his maternal 
grandfather Chetak, he thought—""I should send an emissary to bring back Sechanak 
elephant and the eighteen string necklace."" With this idea he called an emissary and 
instructed—""Beloved of gods I Go to Vaishali city and after greeting King Chetak with hails 
of victory convey this message—My lord ! King Kunik humbly submits that prince Vehalla 
has gone there with Sechanak elephant and the eighteen string necklace without informing 
King Kunik. Therefore, my lord ! please oblige King Kunik by returning Sechanak elephant 
and the eighteen string necklace. Also, please send prince Vehalla back.' "" 
The emissary accepted King Kunik's order joining his palms and returned to his 
residence. From there, like Chitta charioteer (this refers to the elaborate preparations made 
by Chitta charioteer before leaving for Shravasti as mentioned in Rayapaseniya Sutra), he left 
after breakfast and taking short breaks on the way for rest, he arrived in Vaishali. In 
Vaishali he came to King Chetak's palace, stopped his chariot at the outer assembly 
and alighted.

He took the costly gifts suitable for great men; he had brought along and 
entered the outer assembly where King Chetak was sitting. He joined his palms and 
greeted the king with hails of victory. After this he submitted—My lord ! King Kunik 
humbly submits that prince Vehalla has come here with Sechanak elephant and the 
eighteen string necklace without informing King Kunik... and so on up to... please 
send prince Vehalla back."" 
On hearing the emissary's submission King Chetak said—""Beloved of gods ! 
As King Kunik is the son of King Shrenik and Queen Chelana and my grandson, so 
is prince Vehalla. (In other words, both are same for me.) 
""King Shrenik had given Sechanak elephant and the eighteen string necklace 
to prince Vehalla during his life time. Therefore if King Kunik wants to take these two 
things he should give prince Vehalla half of his kingdom and state. Once he does so, 
I will return Sechanak elephant and the eighteen string necklace to King Kunik and 
also send back prince Vehalla. 
With this candid reply King Chetak dismissed the emissary with formal 
greetings and honour. 
After being dismissed by King Chetak the emissary came where his four-bell 
chariot was parked. He boarded the chariot and passing through Vaishali city, resting at 
suitable places, taking his breakfast and meals at proper time arrived at Champa city. 
There (coming to King Kunik) he greeted the king with hails of victory and said—""My 
lord ! King Chetak has said—As King Kunik is the son of King Shrenik and Queen 
Chelana and my grandson, so is prince Vehalla. (and he repeated King Chetak's 
aforesaid message)' Therefore, my lord ! King Chetak is not prepared to either return 
Sechanak elephant and the eighteen string necklace or send back prince Vehalla."" 
On getting this reply from King Chetak, King Kunik once again called the 
emissary and said—""Beloved of gods ! Go to Vaishali once again. Reaching there 
convey this message to my maternal grandfather King Chetak—My lord ! King Kunik 
submits this request—whatever gems (valuables) are found in a kingdom traditionally 
belong to the king. During his reign and ruling over his subjects King Shrenik had 
obtained two gems, namely Sechanak elephant and the eighteen string necklace. 
Therefore, my lord! Following the norms of royal tradition you should kindly return 
Sechanak elephant and the eighteen string necklace. Also send back prince Vehalla.' "" 
The emissary listened to and happily accepted King Kunik's order. He then went 
to Vaishali and conveyed King Kunik's message—`My lord ! King Kunik once again 
submits his request that whatever gems (valuables) are found in a kingdom traditionally 
belong to the king. Therefore, kindly return Sechanak elephant and the eighteen string 
necklace. Also send back prince Vehalla."" 
King Chetak said to the emissary—""Beloved of gods ! As King Kunik is the 
son of King Shrenik and Queen Chelana and my grandson, so is prince Vehalla...."" 
and so on as he had said earlier, and dismissed the emissary with formal greetings 
and honour. 
The emissary returned to Champa city and after greeting King Kunik 
submitted—""My lord ! King Chetak has said—`Beloved of gods ! As King Kunik is the 
son of King Shrenik and Queen Chelana and my grandson, so is prince Vehalla.' 
(and he repeated King Chetak's aforesaid message) Therefore, my lord ! King 
Chetak is not prepared to either return Sechanak elephant and the eighteen string 
necklace or send back prince Vehalla.""

****    
[18] Meaning- On hearing King Chetak's reply from the emissary King Kunik 
turned red with anger. Gnashing his teeth he called the emissary a third time and said—
""Beloved of gods ! Go to Vaishali city and deliver this letter to King Chetak after kicking 
his throne with your left foot and pointing the tip of your spear at him. After delivering the 
letter display your anger by gnashing your teeth and raising your eyebrows to make 
three lines appear on your forehead. Expressing your anger thus, tell him—Desirous of 
untimely death, 0 unfortunate and shameless King Chetak ! King Kunik commands you 
to either return Sechanak elephant and the eighteen string necklace and send back 
prince Vehalla or prepare yourself for a war. Soon King Kunik is coming here with all his 
military might including army, infantry and all, ready to wage a war."" 
As he had done earlier, the emissary accepted King Kunik's order joining his 
palms. He rushed to Vaishali and visited King Chetak. After hails of victory and formal 
greetings he said—""My lord ! I have expressed my modesty, devotion and courtesy for 
you. But King Kunik has ordered me to kick your throne with my left foot, display my 
anger, and deliver you his letter with the tip of my spear. Also to tell you that prepares 
yourself for war. He is soon coming here with his army."" 
Hearing this threat from the emissary and pondering over it King Chetak was 
filled with anger. He raised his eyebrows and said—""I will neither return Sechanak 
elephant and the eighteen string necklace nor send back prince Vehalla. Yes ! I am 
ready for a war."" With these words he summarily dismissed the emissary to leave 
through the rear gate as a token of insult and dishonor. 
Getting this news from the emissary and pondering over it, King Chetak was filled 
with anger. He then called the ten princes including Kaal Kumar and said—""Beloved of 
gods! I would like to inform you that without informing me prince Vehalla has eloped from 
Champa with his family, household things, Sechanak elephant and the eighteen string 
necklace. He has gone to Vaishali and settled there under protection of Arya Chetak. I had 
sent an emissary to King Chetak to return Sechanak elephant and the eighteen string 
necklace and also send back prince Vehalla. But King Chetak refused to return Sechanak 
elephant, the eighteen string necklace and prince Vehalla as they are under his protection. 
Not only this, he insulted and dismissed my third emissary through the rear gate. Therefore, 
0 Beloved of gods ! We should now fight a war with King Chetak and punish him."" 
The ten princes including Kaal Kumar humbly accepted King Kunik's proposal. 
Then King Kunik said to the ten princes including Kaal Kumar—""Beloved of gods ! Go 
to your respective kingdoms and after due lustration by taking bath and performing other rituals 
ride the best of your elephants. After that each one of you should assemble his army 
consisting of three thousand elephants, three thousand chariots, three thousand horses and 
thirty million soldiers. With all your opulence and grandeur along with the great army leave your 
respective kingdoms and march with drum beats to join me. 
On getting these instructions from King Kunik the ten princes including Kaal Kumar 
returned to their respective kingdoms and after due lustration by taking bath... and so on 
up to... and thirty million soldiers. With all their opulence and grandeur along with the great 
army they left their respective kingdoms and marched with drum beats and sounds of a 
variety of musical instruments to join King Kunik at Champa city, the capital of Anga state. 
Arriving there they joined their palms and greeted him with hails of victory. 
King Kunik called his attendants and instructed—""Beloved of gods ! Prepare for 
me the best of elephants suitable for use of a monarch. Also call the four prong army with 
the best of horses, elephants, chariots, and warriors to attention or a state of  readiness.

readiness. Inform me when you do all this. The attendants did as instructed and informed 
the king accordingly. 
King Kunik then entered his bathroom. After taking his bath, getting dressed 
and adorning himself with ornaments he came to the outer court. There he rode the 
great elephant. 
Now King Kunik, with three thousand elephants, three thousand horses... and 
so on up to... marched with drum beats and sounds of a variety of musical 
instruments, crossed Champa city and joined the ten princes including Kaal Kumar 
where they had camped. 
Surrounded by thirty three thousand elephants, thirty three thousand chariots, 
thirty three thousand horses and three hundred thirty million soldiers; with all his opulence 
King Kunik marched with drum beats and sounds of a variety of musical instruments. 
Resting at suitable places, taking his breakfast and meals at proper time, camping after 
covering limited stretches and without unduly extending the march, he passed through the 
Anga state and moved towards Vaishali, the capital of Videh state. 
When King Chetak got the news of King Kunik's march, he invited the eighteen 
kings including nine heads of the Lichchhivi republics and nine of Mallaki republics 
of Kashi-Kaushal states for consultation. When they assembled he said—
""Beloved of gods ! Without informing King Kunik prince Vehalla has come 
here with Sechanak elephant and the eighteen string necklace.  
Kunik had sent emissaries three times to get Sechanak elephant and 
the eighteen string necklace. But I refused for a valid reason (King Shrenik 
had given Sechanak elephant and the eighteen string necklace to prince Vehalla 
during his life time. Therefore if King Kunik wants to take these two things he 
should give prince Vehalla half of his kingdom and state.) And sent back the 
emissaries. King Kunik did not accept my proposal and is marching here 
with his four pronged army to wage a war. 
""Under the circumstances, Beloved of gods ! should we return Sechanak 
elephant and the eighteen string necklace ? Should we surrender prince Vehalla to 
him or fight a war? 
The eighteen kings including nine heads of the Lichchhivi republics and nine of 
Mallaki republics of Kashi-Kaushal states said to King Chetak—""Lord ! It is neither 
proper, nor opportune or suitable to the prestige of a king that we return Sechanak 
elephant and the eighteen string necklace or surrender prince Vehalla. Therefore, when 
King Kunik is marching here with his four pronged army to wage a war we will face him 
by fighting the war."" 
King Chetak said to the eighteen kings including nine heads of the Lichchhivi 
republics and nine of Mallaki republics of Kashi-Kaushal states—""Beloved of gods ! If 
you are ready to fight a war with King Kunik, please return to your respective kingdoms 
and after due lustration by taking bath and performing other rituals... and so on up to... 
Arriving there they joined their palms .and greeted him with hails of victory.  
King Chetak called his attendants and instructed—""Beloved of gods ! Prepare 
for me the best of elephants suitable for the use of a monarch... and so on...  
 (When the eighteen heads of republics arrived in Vaishali) King Chetak, like King 
Kunik, came out with three thousand elephants (etc.) and marching through Vaishali 
came where the eighteen kings including nine heads of the Lichchhivi republics and 
nine of Mallaki republics of Kashi-Kaushal states had camped.

Surrounded by fifty seven thousand elephants, fifty seven thousand chariots, 
fifty seven thousand horses and five hundred seventy million soldiers and with all his 
opulence, King Chetak marched with drum beats and sounds of a variety of musical 
instruments. Resting at suitable places, taking his breakfast and meals at proper 
time, camping after covering limited stretches, he passed through the Videh state 
and reached the state border. There he established forward cantonment and waited 
for King Kunik in a state of full alert. 
On the other side King Kunik with all his opulence and glory made a 
tumultuous arrival in the border area and camped one Yojan away from King 
Chetak's camp. 
After that both the kings got the battle field prepared (by clearing bushes and 
other obstacles) -and performed auspicious rites for their respective victory. 
Now King Kunik organized his army of thirty three thousand elephants... and 
so on up to... three hundred thirty million soldiers in eagle shaped battle formation 
(garuda vyuha). He prepared for the Rath-musal battle in the eagle formation 
On the other side King Chetak organized his army of fifty seven thousand 
elephants... and so on up to... five hundred seventy million soldiers in cart shaped 
battle formation (shakat vyuha). He prepared for Rath-musal battle in cart formation. 
Thus getting ready for war wearing armours (etc.), carrying countering weapons 
(aayudh) and attacking weapons (praharan), tying shields on hands, drawing swords 
from sheaths, and drawing arrows from quivers; the two armies, with all their prowess 
accompanied by drum beats and sounds of a variety of musical instruments, marched 
and engaged. Launching arrows, waving left hands, emitting tumultuous sound from 
bells tied to thighs, blowing trumpets, shouting loud challenges like roar of a sea, horse 
riders started fighting with horse riders, elephant riders with elephant riders, charioteers 
with charioteers and foot soldiers with foot soldiers. 
Enthused to follow the command and control of their respective kings, the two armies 
started wreaking unending slaughter, killing, repression, fear and terror. The dismembered and 
falling heads were bobbing and swinging like things caught in a whirlwind. The ground was 
turning slimy with blood. The warriors thus fought a fierce battle. 
Kaal Kumar, along with three thousand elephants... and so on up to... thirty million 
foot soldiers in. eagle formation, supporting King Kunik and forming the eleventh part of his 
army, fought in the Rath-musal battle against King Chetak... and so on up to... In just one 
shot Kaal Kumar fell on the ground like a broken peak of a hill, as told by Bhagavan 
Mahavir to Queen Kaali, and died on the spot. 
(Narrating these details Bhagavan Mahavir added-) Therefore, Gautam ! As 
Kaal Kumar embraced his death due to intense sinful activities and evil deeds, he 
has taken birth in the Hemabh Narak (name  of a specific area in the infernal world) of 
the Pankaprabha Prithvi (the fourth hell) as a nairayik (infernal being). 
Commentary- Garuda Vyuha (eagle formation)- This aphorism mentions 
garuda vyuha and shakat vyuha (cart formation). Garuda Vyuha (eagle formation) 
means the arrangement of army where the spearhead is massive like an eagle. This 
frightens the opposing army facilitating an effective initial attack. 
Shakat vyuha (cart formation) means an arrangement where the spearhead is 
formed predominantly by chariots (shakat), middle portion has lesser density of 
chariots and the rear, once again, has higher density of chariots. 
Kunik arranged his army in the eagle formation and Chetak in cart formation.

More details about the Rath-musal battle are mentioned in Bhagavati Sutra the gist 
of which is as follows :-- 
Rath-Musal Battle- In the aforesaid aphorism, it is mentioned that for the Rath-
musal battle Kunik used the eagle formation. In Bhagavati Sutra there is a mention of 
two great battles fought by Kunik and Chetak. Of these the Mahashilakantak battle- 
was fought on the first day and the Rath-musal battle on the second. This war ended 
in defeat of King Chetak's armies and victory of King Kunik. But according to this 
description in Niryavalika Sutra the first ten days of the war saw the deaths of the ten 
brothers including Kaal Kumar. From this mention it appears that the 
Mahashilakantak and Rath-musal battles were fought after the first ten days of the 
war. Other ancient scriptures also confirm this. 
As the story goes, in the first ten days of the great war the ten commanders of 
Kunik's army (his ten brothers) were killed by just one shot of arrow each by King Chetak. 
On the eleventh day it was the turn of Kunik and he had the fear of life. He thought—The 
arrow launched by King Chetak is unsurmountable. I will never be able to conquer him.' 
And he came out with a solution. He called a cease fire for three days. After a three 
day fast he evoked Shakrendra and Chamarendra, his friendly gods from past birth. 
Shakrendra said—""I cannot kill King Chetak as he is a highly valorous and 
righteous shravak (devout Jain). However, as a friend I will make arrangements for 
your security. As a gesture of friendship Shakrendra created diamond hard and 
impenetrable dress and armor with his divine power. By wearing it Kunik became 
fully protected. With his divine powers Chamarendra created two war-machines 
called Mahashilakantak and Rath-musal. 
In the Mahashilakantak battle missiles including foliage, wood, pebbles, and rocks 
were launched with the divine war-machine. These missiles hit the opposing army like a 
great boulder (mahashila) and the fiercest of weapons of the opposition was rendered 
ineffective like a small thorn (kantak). In this battle eight million four hundred thousand 
soldiers were killed. In this battle the commander of King Chetak's army was Varun, a 
devout and scholarly shravak. He was the grandson of Naag and had taken an oath that 
he will not kill an innocent being. Varun killed the commander of Kunik's army, Vajri. 
Kunik, himself was protected by his divine armour and King Chetak could not penetrate it 
with his one arrow. According to his vow, Chetak did not use another arrow. 
On the second day Kunik used the divine machines (Rath-musal) made in the 
form of automated chariots, which had neither horses nor charioteers or warriors. 
These chariots were fitted with maces. While moving, this chariot trampled and 
destroyed the opposing army with its maces in motion. This killing machine turned 
human beings into bloody slime covering the battle ground. In this battle nine million 
six hundred thousand men were annihilated. Chetak's unsurmountable arrow was 
wasted this day also. 
Dejected by this defeat Chetak retreated to Vaishali city. Closing the city gates 
he went into the paushadhshala (place of stay for ascetics) and sat in meditation. Kunik 
could not open or break the strong gates of Vaishali. At last he resorted to deception 
and guile to destroy Vaishali. 
In context of the size of the army the term `kodi' (koti) has been frequently used 
in this aphorism. Traditionally it has been translated as crore (ten million) [But in many 
instances this interpretation does not fit and requires more detailed analysis.] At some place 
kodi (koti) means crore and at some other place it is used to indicate the colloquial term for

a count of 20. This is because in his works `Sarva Sangh ke Samast Acharya Sanghayan' 
and Visheshavati' Shri Jinabhadra Gani Kshamashraman mentions that some acharyas 
do not accept that the term `kodi' means crore. They believe that it is a noun coined for 
some specific number. The evidence for this is that even in modern times a count of twenty 
is called `kodi'. Also, in Maharashtra five annas make a kodi (five annas have twenty 
paise). As kodi represents a specific unit, it would not be surprising if the term 'shat-
sahastra' also represents some such unit. In the statement that the number of ascetics 
liberated from Shatrunjaya is five kodi, the term kodi means some specific unit. In the same 
way 56 kodi (koti) Yadays is also some specific unit. The use of the terms `kodi', and 'shat-
sahasra' with reference to the armies of King Kunik and King Chetak also denote some 
specific units. Therefore it is not proper to believe that one word has just one meaning. 
Jinabhadra Gani Kshamashraman provides authentication of this view. 
""It is possible that the term `kodi' (koti) has been used to indicate a group of 
soldiers exactly as terms like company, battalion or brigade are used in modern army 
terminology. The exact number of soldiers forming a company or other such group 
varies from army to army and is not fixed universally. In the same way the number of 
soldiers in a kodi may also not have been fixed. Anyway, the exact meaning was 
known only to the omniscient.""  
[19] Meaning Gautam Swami again asked—""Bhante ! Where will Kaal Kumar 
go from the fourth hell ? Where will he reincarnate? 
""Gautam ! Like prince Dradhapratijna he will be born in the Mahavideh area, in 
one of the clans that are affluent, brilliant, influential, and wealthy. He will then attain

APPENDIX 
Aupapaatik Sutra and Niryavalika Sutra contain ample details about Magadh 
Emperor Kunik. In Aupapaatik, Kunik has been described as an ideal ruler and a devotee of 
the Jina but in Niryavalika he has been painted differently as an ambitious and egotistic ruler 
with territorial ambitions and a person who killed his father. 
In order to properly and chronologically understand the brief description about 
Emperor Shrenik and Kunik available here, we present the story with some more details. 
Magadh Emperor Shrenik was the eldest, most valourous and intelligent among the 
hundred sons of King Prasenjit who was a devotee of Bhagavan Parshva Nath. When King 
Prasenjit realized that his sons, coveting for the throne, are looking for opportunities to kill 
each other, he exiled Shrenik on some pretext, in order to save him. During this period of 
exile Shrenik took refuge in Buddhist monasteries and came in contact with Bhikshus. 
Impressed by their good treatment he developed a healthy respect for them. 
During this exile he also got married to Nanda, the highly virtuous and intelligent 
daughter of a rich merchant of Venatat city. There only, Nanda gave birth to a son who later 
became famous as Abhaya Kumar, the storehouse of wisdom. On getting the news of his 
father's death, Shrenik returned to Rajagriha and ascended the throne. With his intelligence, 
state-craft and valour he took the Magadh empire to new heights of prosperity and glory. 
In Jain literature Shrenik is popularly known as Bhambhasar and in Buddhist 
literature as Bimbasar. 
There is a mention of King Shrenik's twenty five queens in Agamic and other scriptures of 
Jains. In Antakriddashanga there is a mention of twenty three queens of Shrenik including Nanda, 
Nandamati, Kaali, and Sukaali. After the death of Shrenik they all got initiated in Bhagavan 
Mahavir's order and attained nirvana after rigorous - austerities. In Jnatadharmakathanga is 
the mention of Megh Kumar's mother queen Dharini and in Dashashrutaskandh that of 
Kunik's mother Queen Chelana. 
In various Agam works we find mention of thirty six sons of Shrenik. In 
AnuttarAupapaatik Sutra we find mention of twenty three sons including Jaali and Mayali. 
They all got initiated and after rigorous austerities reincarnated as gods in Anuttar Vimans. 
The story of Megh Kumar is available in Jnata Sutra. Nandishen also became an ascetic and 
took to the spiritual path. Niryavalika has the description of Kunik and his ten brothers 
including Kaal Kumar. 
There is a mention of three sons of Shrenik by Queen Chelana—Kunik, Vehalla, and 
Vehayas. In Niryavalika there is a brief description of the birth of Kunik. This incident 
conveys that the feeling of animosity for Shrenik in Kunik's mind had its root in their 
relationship in the past births. 
Many births earlier the king of Basantpur  had a son named Sumangal who was highly 
virtuous and religious. Senak, the minister's son, was his friend. Senak was ugly in 
appearance. In light vein Prince Sumangal used to make fun of his ugliness constantly. Fed 
up of the sarcastic remarks on his ugly appearance, Senak left his house, went into the jungle 
and started practicing austerities in solitude. He made his body weak and emaciated by 
observing month long fasts. Once hermit Senak came to Basantpur. Prince Sumangal went to 
pay him homage and invited him to break his month long fast in the palace. On the day of 
fast-breaking Senak went to the palace. But as King Sumangal got sick the previous night he 
slept till late in the morning. The hermit returned without breaking his fast and he commenced 
another month long fast. When Sumangal came to know that the hermit had returned without 
breaking his fast, he came to Senak and sought his forgiveness. This time also he invited the 
hermit to the palace for breaking his fast . The second time also Senak came to the palace

****                                                                                                                                                
but the king was indisposed and the palace guard sent back the hermit without offering him 
food. Senak commenced his third month long fasting. 
Sumangal again came and sought forgiveness. He once again beseeched Senak to 
come to the palace to break his third month long fast. Coincidentally this time also Sumangal fell 
ill on the day of fast-breaking. Senak came with the intention of seeking alms for breakfast. The 
guard thought that every time that hermit came the king fell sick, thus he was ominous. The 
irritated guards flogged the hermit and threw him out. The hermit got enraged and resolved—
""I will take revenge. I will make him suffer flogging and hunger."" 
After death hermit Senak reincarnated as a Vanavyantar (interstitial) god. Then 
Sumangal reincarnated as King Prasenjit's son Shrenik and the interstitial god that was 
hermit Senak reincarnated as Queen Chelana's son Kunik. The feelings of animosity from 
the earlier births surfaced and inspired Chelana to eat flesh from Shrenik's belly. Chelana 
considered her son as killer of his father from the very beginning. 
Even when Shrenik became old he delayed transferring of power to his son and heir 
Kunik. At last, driven by his intense desire for power, Kunik conspired with his ten brothers 
including Kaal Kumar and imprisoned Shrenik, deprived him of food and water, and flogged 
him with a whip. According to the authors, this incident was caused by precipitation of the 
animosity from the past births. 
According to Niryavalika Sutra Kunik fought a war for the great elephant Sechanak 
and the eighteen string necklace called Vankachula. These two things were priceless 
treasures of the state of Magadh. The story of their acquisition goes like this— 
In the forests around Rajagriha there was a hermitage. There a she-elephant secretly gave 
birth to a little elephant in a thick cluster of trees. Since the very beginning this baby elephant lived 
with the hermits. The hermits loved him very much and fed him bananas and other fruits. When the 
hermits brought water from the river to water the plants in the hermitage, the baby elephant would 
also imitate them by bringing water in his trunk. As he watered the plants the hermits named him 
Sechanak (one who waters plants). Sechanak grew to be a very strong bull elephant. He roamed 
around alone in the jungle. Some times he would fight other elephants and at others root out and 
toss around large trees. Once an old elephant crossed his path and Sechanak fought it bitterly and 
wounded it. This victory did not pacify his rage and when he came to the hermitage he was still 
mad. He entered the hermitage trumpeting angrily and trampled the banana trees and other plants. 
When the hermits saw all this they scolded Sechanak but this added fuel to the fire. Sechanak 
continued his trampling and destroying vegetation in the jungle. Fed up with this the hermits sought 
help from King Shrenik. The soldiers of the king trapped the elephant and brought it to the Kings 
elephant yard. When Abhaya Kumar saw Sechanak he informed that this was a rare elephant 
known as GandhHasti and was very auspicious. It deserved being made the chief elephant of state. 
King Shrenik followed Abhaya Kumar's advice and Sechanak became the chief elephant. A Gandh 
Hasti emits an aroma that draws she-elephants to it but male elephants get panicky and run away. 
Sechanak elephant was endowed with the knowledge of his past birth and his 
sensory knowledge was also pristine. He was faithful to his master. In scriptures we find 
mention of two such great elephants of that era—Sechanak elephant of Magadh and Analgiri 
elephant of King Chandapradyot of Ujjayini. 
King Shrenik was once returning after attending discourse of Bhagavan Mahavir. On 
the way in a jungle he saw an ascetic plucking raw fruits from trees and eating them. Shrenik 
advised him—""O muni ! Why do you indulge in an activity proscribed in the religious code ?"" 
The ascetic replied—""I am very hungry."" 
The king said—""Come with me. I will offer you food acceptable for an ascetic."" 
The ascetic argued—""What do you know ? All shramans (ascetic followers of 
Bhagavan Mahavir) secretly pluck fruits from trees and eat.""

****       
Shrenik  refuted—""Why do you tell a lie ? The ascetic followers of Bhagavan Mahavir are 
upright and immaculate in maintaining purity of conduct."" 
On proceding ahead Shrenik saw a young and beautiful saadhvi (female ascetic) 
washing parts of her body on the bank of a lake. The king was surprised when he also found 
that she was pregnant. He admonished her for this misdeed. The saadhvi slandered all the 
saadhvis of Bhagavan Mahavir's order blaming them generally indulging in such misdeeds. 
The king rebuked her—""You should be ashamed of blaming falsely the true followers 
of ascetic conduct just in order to conceal your misdeed. It is my unwavering belief that all 
the shramans and shramanis (male and female ascetics) of Bhagavan Mahavir's order are 
true followers of pure ascetic conduct. What you say is absolutely false."" 
Seeing King Shrenik's absolutely unwavering faith for Bhagavan Mahavir's order a 
divine person appeared and said after greeting—""O King Indra had praised your perfect 
righteousness. In order to test it I created all this. Please pardon me. You are, indeed, an 
extremely righteous person with purity of faith."" With this honour the god gave two gifts to King 
Shrenik—a divine eighteen string necklace and two earthen balls. The king gave the 
Vankachula necklace to Queen Chelana and the earthen balls to Abhaya Kumar's mother 
Queen Nanda. Queen Nanda felt insulted on seeing the earthen balls and threw them. The 
balls broke and from one came out a pair of divine earrings and from the other a divine dress. 
The great elephant Sechanak and the divine eighteen string necklace called 
Vankachula were two priceless treasures of the state of Magadh. According to Avashyak 
Churni these two were valued to be equal to all the remaining wealth of the Magadh empire.

[20] Meaning-  JambuSwami asked Sudharma Swami—""Bhante ! If this is the 
text and meaning of the first chapter of Niryavalika as told by Bhagavan Mahavir, 
Bhante ! what is the text and meaning of the second chapter of Niryaavalika as told 
by Bhagavan Mahavir ? 
Arya Sudharma replied—""Long lived Jambu ! During that period of time there 
was a city called Champa. Outside this city was a garden called Purnabhadra. The 
city was ruled by King Kunik. The consort of the King was queen Padmavati. 
Also in Champa city, there lived Sukaali Devi, wife of King Shrenik and a step 
mother of King Kunik. She had a delicate body. 
Sukaali Devi had a son named Sukaal Kumar. He was also delicate and 
handsome. That Sukaal Kumar, along with three thousand elephants (etc.) joined 
King Kunik in the Rath-musal battle (remaining description same as in case of Kaal 
Kumar fighting the Rath-musal battle). After death he has reincarnated in the fourth hell. 
From there he will reincarnate in the Mahavideh Varsh area and end all his miseries 
by attaining liberation. Complete description should be taken similar to that in case of 
Kaal Kumar.

[21] Meaning- The remaining eight chapters (3rd to 10th) are same as the first 
chapter. The only difference is that the names of the princes are similar to the names of 
their respective mothers.  
Commentary- For example—the name of the son of Queen Mahakali is 
Mahakaal, son of Queen Krishnadevi is son of Queen Sukrishnadevi is Sukrishna, and 
so on. One after the other all these princes became the commanders of Kunik's army 
and were killed by the arrows of King Chetak. 
Thus in the fierce battles fought for ten days all these ten princes died in the 
battlefield. The description of their reincarnation is also the same. They all will 
reincarnate in future in the Mahavideh area, get initiated, destroy all karmas through 
austerities and attain liberation.

◙ INTRODUCTION:- 
The first section titled Niryaavalika contains the stories of King Shrenik's ten sons 
from his ten queens including Queen Kaali. As a result of their indulgence in extreme 
violence, sin, and evil conduct they all were born in hell after their death. As it contains 
the description of hell-bound beings this section is named Niryaavalika. 
When the ten queens including Kaali listened from Bhagavan Mahavir about the 
sad demise of their sons and their passage to hell, they got detached from mundane 
pleasures. They all got initiated in Bhagavan Mahavir's order. They attained salvation 
by indulging in rigorous austerities. The description of their initiation and austerities is 
available in Antakrid-dashanga Sutra. 
It is quite possible that when the sons of these princes including Kaal Kumar 
heard the description of the bad end of their fathers, they were also filled with 
aversion for the mundane and regal pleasures and got detached. After that these 
princes also attended Bhagavan Mahavir's discourse and got initiated. 
After their death, King Shrenik's ten sons went to hell due to their 
covetousness for the throne. But his grandsons renounced the regal grandeur and 
went to heaven after dressing intense austerities. 
Brief description of initiation of these princes including Padma is given in this 
second section titled Kalpavatansika. As this contains the story of those destined to 
the Kalp Vimans (celestial vehicles), this section named Kalpavatansika is known as a 
ninth UPANG now-a-days. It seems to be an upang of ninth Ang-Sootra named 
Anuttaropapaatikdasa. This Aagam contains ten chapters. 
 
 
 
[1] Meaning- Jambu Swami asked—""Bhante ! When aforesaid is the text and 
meaning of the first section of the Upanga named Niryavalika as given by Shraman 
Bhagavan Mahavir, who has attained the eternal abode of theSiddha-state, how 
many chapters are said to be there in the second section called Kalpavatansika ?"" 
Sudharma Swami replied ""Jambu ! Shraman Bhagavan Mahavir has preached 
ten chapters of Kalpavatansika, the second section. They are—(1) Padma, (2) 
Mahapadma, (3) Bhadra, (4) Subhadra, (5) Padmabhadra,(6) Padmasen, (7) 
Padmagulma, (8) Nalinigulma, (9) Anand, and (10) Nandan. 
Jambu- ""Bhante ! If there are ten chapters in Kalpavatansika, as given by 
Shraman Bhagavan. Mahavir, what is the text and meaning of the first chapter of 
Kalpavatansika ?"" 
Sudharma Swami—""Jambu ! During that period of time there was a city called 
Champa. There was a garden called Purnabhadra (outside this city in the north-east 
direction). The ruler of the city was King Kunik. His consort was queen Padmavati. 
(detailed description as in Aupapatik Sutra) 
Also in Champa city lived Kaali Devi, wife of King Shrenik and a step mother 
of King Kunik. She too had delicate limbs and was very beautiful. Kaali Devi had son 
named Kaal Kumar. This Kaal Kumar's consort was Padmavati, who was very  
delicate. She lived happily enjoying comforts of life.

****         
 Once Padmavati Devi was sleeping in her royal bedroom which was beautifully 
decorated with a variety of paintings. During the night, while comfortably sleeping, she 
woke up after seeing a lion in her dream. In due course she gave birth to a son. His birth 
was celebrated like that of Mahabal. It was announced—""As this child is the son of Kaal 
Kumar and Padmavati, he should be named Padma."" Thus the boy was given this name. 
All other details should be taken exactly as those in case of Mahabal; that is:- 
He was brought up in regal grandeur and was sent to a teacher where he learned 
seventy two arts. When he grew mature he was married to eight princesses and his 
parents gave him marriage gifts in sets of eight. Padma Kumar lived in the upper portion 
of a grand mansion and enjoyed all comforts of life. 
Once the samavasaran (religious assembly) of Bhagavan Mahavir was held in 
Champa city. People came to attend the discourse. King Kunik also came to pay his 
homage. Like Mahabal, Padma Kumar also came to pay homage and obeisance. 
Like Mahabal, Padma Kumar (on listening to the sermon) also sought permission from 
his parents and got initiated,... and so on up to... and wandered around after 
becoming a completely celibate anagaar (ascetic). [Story of Mahabal since his birth is in 
Bhagavati Sutra] 
After getting initiated by Shraman Bhagavan Mahavir, that ascetic Padma 
studied all the eleven Angas (canons) including Samayik from the senior ascetics... 
and so on up to... he wandered around enriching his soul by observing various 
austerities including one, two, and three day fasts. 
As Megh Kumar (JnataDharmaKatha Sutra,) resolved to none ahead on the 
spiritual path by observing serial fasts so did Padma. After seeking permission from 
Bhagavan Mahavir he climbed the Vipul-giri hill and commenced his spiritual accent 
by observing padopagaman anashan (lifelong fasting keeping the body motionless like a 
fallen tree). Due to these rigorous austerities his body got extremely weak and 
emaciated and he was reduced to a mere skeleton. 
After studying all the eleven Angas (canons) including Samayik from the senior 
ascetics he immaculately observed the ascetic code for five years. After that he took 
the ultimate vow (sallekhana) of one month duration and met his end at the conclusion 
of the month long fast (avoiding sixty meals). When senior ascetics accompanying him 
saw that he was dead they came and placed his ascetic equipment before Bhagavan. 
Then Gautam Swami asked about the future of ascetic Padma. Bhagavan 
Mahavir replied, ""Gautam ! This ascetic Padma, after rejecting sixty meals (doing a 
month long fast) and doing pratikraman (critical review), has met his end. His soul 
has gone beyond Jyotishk Vimans (the stellar celestial vehicles) including the moon 
and has taken birth as a god in the Saudharma kalp (a dimension of gods). His life 
span there is two Sagaropam."" 
Gautam Swami again asked, ""Bhagavan ! completing the age, state, and life of 
the dimension of gods and descending from there, where will god Padma be born ?"" 
Bhagavan said, ""Gautam ! He will be born as a human being in the Mahavideh 
area and terminate the cycles of rebirth like Dradhapratijna.""       
Sudharma Swami told Jambu, ""Jambu ! Shraman Bhagavan Mahavir, who has 
attained nirvana, has narrated this text and meaning of the first chapter of 
Kalpavatansika. As I have heard from him and so I state.""

[2] Meaning- JambuSwami asked- ""Bhante ! I have heard the text and meaning 
of the first chapter of Kalpavatansika as told by Shraman Bhagavan Mahavir, who 
has attained nirvana. Bhante ! Now please tell me the text and meaning of the 
second chapter of Kalpavatansika."" 
SudharmaSwami replied- ""Long lived Jambu ! It is as follows - 
During that period of time there was a city called Champa. (Outside this city in the north-
east direction) There was a garden called Purnabhadra. The ruler of the city was King Kunik. 
His consort was queen Padmavati. Also in Champa city lived Sukaali Devi, wife of King 
Shrenik and a step mother of King Kunik. Sukaali Devi had a son named Sukaal Kumar. 
This Sukaal Kumar's consort was Mahapadmaa. 
Once Mahapadmaa while sleeping in her comfortable bed saw a dream. Remaining 
details are same as in the first chapter. A son was born and was named Mahapadma. In due 
course he got initiated and finally he will reincarnate as a god ill the Ishan kalp (a dimension of 
gods) having a life span of maximum two Sagaropam. After completing the life-span there he 
will be born in the Mahavideh area and get perfection, enlightenment and liberation. 
""Long lived Jambu ! Bhagavan Mahavir has narrated this text and meaning of 
the second chapter of Kalpavatansika. As I have heard from him and so I state.""

[2] Meaning- The stories given in the following eight chapters are same as the 
preceding ones. The name of the mothers are similar to those of the sons; for example 
mother of Bhadra Kumar is Bhadra, that of Subhadra Kumar is Subhadra, and so on. All these 
were sons of the ten princes including Kaal Kumar respectively. The span of the part 
of their life they spent as ascetics was as follows— 
 [2] Meaning- (1) Padma and (2) Mahapadma- five years each. (3) Bhadra, 
(4) Subhadra, and (5) Padmabhadra- four years each. (6) Padmasen, (7) Padma 
gulma and (8) Nalinigulma—three years each. (9) Anand and (10) Nandan- two 
years each. They all were grandsons of King Shrenik. 
[2] Meaning- Additional information to be known about their life is- They progressed 
in this order:- they were born, got initiated and after death were instantaneously 
reincarnated as gods in this order—first in Saudharma kalp, second in Ishan kalp, third 
in Sanatkumar kalp, fourth in Mahendra kalp, fifth in Brahma kalp, sixth in Lantak kalp, 
seventh in Mahashukra kalp, eighth in Sahasrara kalp, ninth in Pranat kalp, and tenth in 
Achyut kalp. There life-span there is maximum of the specific kalp.  
They will descend from the heavens to reincarnate in Mahavideh area and 
become Siddhas (liberated souls).

◙ Something about This Publication ◙ 
 
We have already published 45 Aagams in Four languages Prakrut, Sanskrut 
(Satik), Hindi and Gujarati.  Now a day for new generation & abroad living people, 
English translation has become a necessity.  So we have planned to translate or 
compile Jain-Aagam in English. We gave priority to Nandi Sootra because it’s known as 
wellbeing & auspicious sootra. The Theme of Nandi is knowledge; Nandi-sootra mainly 
describes five types of “ान-(Jnanas)”.  
 
After that we have started Niraayavalika panchak, from that panchak, here 
we are giving meaning with commentary of Kalpavatansika. 
 
Kalpavatansika is an “Ang-bahya”Aagam, at present it is known as “Upang” 
Sootra. Shree Chandra-Suri has written Vrutti [commentary] on kalpavatansika  
 
Here, we have compiled Translation done by Surendra Bothara, which is 
originally edited in to Hindi by Shree Am ar-Muni & Shree Chandra Surana, We have  
two motives for publishing this book.—[1] To provide Aagam literature in English & [2] It 
should be given in Microsoft Word format so people can do Cut, Paste & Editing by 
themselves also. 
 
At present this Book is published as a Net-Publication with the help of the Jain 
Education International organization of America.  In future we may publish it as a Book 
also. We are also planning to put more Aagams in English before you. 
 
We also invite learned persons to translate more & more ‘authentic Jain literature 
in English for kids and youths, so the ignorant-people of regional languages can also 
read or learn our “Shashtra & Granth”. 
 
We are very much thankful to Shree Pravinbhai, Sudeshbhai, Late Mr. Krupal 
Shah and all other known-unknown persons who helpd us for this project directly or 
indirectly.

◙   INTRODUCTION:- 
The first and second sections have incidents of Bhagavan Mahavir's period 
whereas the ten chapters of the third section, Pushpika, now-a-days which is known as 
Upang-10 (Aagam-21), contain stories related to periods of Bhagavan Mahavir and 
Bhagavan ParshvaNath both. Jyotishk Raajaas (kings of the stellar gods) including 
Chandra and Surya along with many other powerful goddesses come to behold and pay 
homage to Bhagavan Mahavir.  
There the present dramatic performances in order to express their devotion and 
respect for Bhagavan Mahavir as also to display their opulence and grandeur. After their 
departure GautamSwami inquires about their past births. Bhagavan Mahavir narrates 
religious conduct of those gods and goddesses during their past births. These details 
from past births relate to the period of influence of Bhagavan ParshvaNath. 
Important thing is that in the first four chapters the concerned individuals died in 
unrighteous state of mind because, even while indulging in rigorous austerities, they did 
not pursue spiritual purity by performing critical review for transgressions in their accepted 
vows. This indicates that during last moments of his life an aspirant should essentially 
pursue spiritual purity by performing critical review for the transgressions in vows. 
 
 
[1] Meaning- Jambu Swami asked-""Bhante! When aforesaid is the text and 
meaning of the second section of the Upanga named Kalpavatansika as given by      
Shraman Bhagavan Mahavir, what is the text and meaning of the third section of the 
Upanga named Pushpika ?"" 
Sudharma Swami replied ""Jambu ! Shraman Bhagavan Mahavir has preached ten 
chapters of Kalpavatansika, third section of the Upanga named Pushpika. They are- 
[2] Meaning-  (1) Chandra, (2) Surya, (3) Shukra, (4) Bahuputrika, (5) Purna-
bhadra, (6) Maanibhadra, (7) Datta, (8) Shiva, (9) Bala, and (10) Anadrit. 
[3] Meaning- Jambu- ""Bhante ! If there are ten chapters in Pushpika, as given by 
Shraman Bhagavan Mahavir, what is the text and meaning of its first chapter?” 
Sudharma Swami replied as follows;- 
""Long lived Jambu ! During that period of time there was a city called Rajagriha 
where there was a chaitya (garden) called Gunasheelak. The ruler of the city was King 
Shrenik. During that period of time Shraman Bhagavan Mahavir arrived at Gunasheelak 
Chaitya in Rajagriha. People came to pay homage. 
During that period of time Chandra, the king of Chandra Jyotishk gods was sitting 
on a throne named Chandra in the Sudharma assembly in Chandravatansak Viman 
(celestial vehicle). [In that assembly four thousand vehicle based gods, four queen-goddesses, 
three types of assemblies, seven armies, seven commanders, sixteen thousand guard-gods and 
a mass of many other gods and goddesses residing in that viman were in attendance.  
They were enjoying the divine pleasures that included drama as well as loud and  resonant                      
musical performance of instruments like ---- Veena,  cymbal,  bronze cymbal,  Trutit, and  Ghan Mridang

played by accomplished artists.] Then with help of his all enveloping Avadhi Jnana he 
observed this whole Jambu continent. Chandra saw Shraman Bhagavan Mahavir I stationed 
there and had a desire to go to pay him homage and obeisance. As Suryabh god had thought 
and made preparations to go to behold Bhagavan (See- Rayapaseniya, Sutra) Chandrabh god 
too called his Abhiyogik Devs (servant-gods) and instructed them to make preparations for 
travel, suitable for kings of gods, and report back. Accordingly the servant-gods made 
preparations suitable for travel of kings of gods and reported back. 
Chandra then instructed the commander of his army of foot soldiers—""Sound the 
melodious bell to inform all gods and goddesses to come to pay homage to Bhagavan."" The 
commander followed the instructions... and so on up to... created arrangements for display of 
stage performances as Suryabh god had done. The only variation from the description of 
Suryabh god is that here the viman was one thousand Yojan in area and sixty two Yojan in 
height and it was preceded by a twenty five Yojan tall flag called Mahendra Dhvaj. Besides 
this all other details of the viman are same as those of Suryabh viman. Also same for Chandra 
god is the description that follows, as to how Suryabh god came to Bhagavan, presented the 
stage performance, and returned. [refer to Rayapaseniya sutra- For Suryabh god 
When Chandra left, Gautam Swami asked Bhagavan Mahavir after paying 
homage and obeisance—""Bhante ! Where did the divine display of opulence and 
powers created by Chandra, the king of Chandra Jyotishk gods, go and disappear?” 
Bhagavan answered the question by giving the example of Kuthagar- ""Gautam ! 
The divine display of opulence and powers created by Chandra was drawn into and 
disappeared within his own body.  
(example of Kutagar according to Rayapaseniya Sutra is as follows —) 
""Gautam ! Suppose there is a cone shaped (like hill-top) camouflaged house, large 
and deep underground. It is plastered within and outside with cow-dung. It is surrounded by 
a parapet wall and has strong and air-tight but concealed doors. A large crowd is sitting 
near that camouflaged house. If that crowd suddenly sees dark rain bearing clouds or a 
terrible storm approaching, it at once enters that camouflaged house and disappears. In the 
same way, Gautam ! all the opulence and divine illusion displayed by Suryabh god entered 
and merged into his body. That is why I said that it entered into his own body.""  
After that Gautam Swami asked—""Bhante ! How did that god acquire that divine 
opulence and power ? Who was he in the past birth ? (What charity had he made ? What 
experience did he gain ? What good deed did he perform ? What conduct did he follow ? And what 
religious and noble words he listened to and accepted from a sagacious Shraman or Brahmin so as 
to be endowed with such divine opulence and power ?) 
Bhagavan Mahavir replied—""Gautam During that period of time there was a city 
named Shravasti. Outside the city there was a Chaitya named Koshthak. In Shravasti 
lived a householder (gathapati) named Angati who was very rich. He was insuperable 
(due to his status and influence he could not be insulted, ignored or belittled by anyone). 
That  Angati Gathapati  (like - Anand Shravak)  enjoyed a very high reputation among 
a large number of traders, merchants, commanders, caravan chiefs, emissaries, 
ambassadors and other citizens of Shravasti asa confidante, arbiter, trouble shooter and 
counselor in diverse matters like general activities, business, social and family problems

and other deliberations. He was the spine, manager, provider and guide of his family. 
He lead the family in every walk of life. 
During that period of time Purushadaniya Arhat Parshva, the propagator of a 
religion similar to Bhagavan Mahavir, was living. He was nine cubits tall. Moving from 
one village to another with his ascetic group of sixteen thousand Shramans (male 
ascetics) and thirty eight thousand Aryaas (female ascetics), Arhat Parshva arrived at 
Koshthak Chaitya (in Shravasti). People came to behold and pay homage to him. 
On getting the news of Bhagavan's arrival Angati Gathapati was pleased and, 
like Kartik merchant, he came out of his house... and so on up to... and commenced 
worship. After listening to and understanding the sermon he said to Bhagavan—
""Beloved of gods ! I would make my eldest son the head of my family and after that I will 
get initiated by you."" In due course he got initiated like Gang-datt... and so on up to... 
became an absolutely celibate anagar (homeless ascetic).(Kartik merchant and Gang-datt 
both lived during the period of influence of the twentieth Tirthankar Bhagavan Munisuvrat. Their 
stories are available in Bhagavati Sutra, and Gyata Dharma katha)  
After studying all the eleven Angas (canons) including Samayik from the senior ascetic 
disciples of Arhat Parshva and enkindling his soul by observing a variety of austerities 
including fasting, he immaculately followed the ascetic code for many years. In the end he 
took the ultimate vow (sallekhana) of half a month duration and met his end at the conclusion of 
fortnight long fast (avoiding thirty meals). As he died without doing pratikraman (critical review) his 
soul has reincarnated instantaneously (upapat) as Chandra, king of Chandra Jyotishk gods, in 
divine bed covered with divine cloth in the Upapat- hall of Chandravatansak viman. 
Thereafter Chandra, the king of Chandra Jyotishk gods attained the state of full 
development (paryapti) through five kinds of full development (paryapti) namely, ahar (food) 
paryapti, sharira (body) paryapti, indriya (sense organs) paryapti, shvasochhavas (breathing) 
paryapti, and bhasha-man (speech and mind) paryapti. 
Gautam Swami asked Bhagavan Mahavir-""Bhante! What is the life span of Chandra, 
the king of Chandra Jyotishk gods ?"" 
""Gautam ! His life span there is one hundred thousand years more than one 
Palyopam. Thus, Gautam ! that Chandra, the king of Chandra Jyotishk gods acquired 
that divine opulence and power."" 
Gautam Swami again asked, ""Bhante ! Completing the age, state, and life of the 
dimension of gods where will Chandra, the king of Chandra Jyotishk gods, be born?” 
Bhagavan said, ""Gautam ! He will be born as a human being in the Mahavideh 
area and finally become a Siddha (liberated soul)."" 
SudharmaSwami told-- ""Jambu! Shraman Bhagavan Mahavir, who has attained 
nirvana, has narrated this text and meaning of first chapter of Pushpika. So I state.""

Gautam Swami further asked about the earlier birth of Shukra god. 
Bhagavan Mahavir replied- ""Gautam ! During that period of time there was a city 
named Varanasi. In Varanasi lived a Brahmin named Somil who was very rich and 
insuperable. He was a scholar of Rugveda (this includes all the four Vedas, history, lexicon, 
grammar, etc.). Once Purushadaniya Arhat Parshva, arrived there. People came to 
behold and pay homage to him. 
On getting news of Arhat Parshva's arrival Somil Brahmin thought—Wandering 
from one village to another Purushadaniya Arhat Parshva has arrived and is stationed 
at Amrashaalvan in Varanasi. I should go and put forth my questions to him and seek 
answers, reasons and elaborations from him. (as described in Vyakhyaprajnapti) 
Then Somil left his house alone without taking his disciples along. He came to 
Bhagavan and asked—""Bhante! How is your journey ? What are your restraints 
(yaapaniya)? How are your defined movement (prasuk vihar)? Are Sarisava (Sarason or 
mustard seeds), Maash (Udad; a kind of pulse;), and Kulattha (Kulathi; horse-bean;) edible 
for you or not ? Are you one ? (Are you two ? Are you many ? etc."" Bhagavan gave suitable 
replies) on getting the answers Somil got enlightened, accepted the Shravak-dharma 
(code of conduct meant for Jain laity). He then returned home. Later Arhat Parshva left 
Amrashaalvan Chaitya in Varanasi and commenced his itinerant life in other areas. 
In the absence of opportunities to behold ascetics who observe great vows, to 
associate himself with Nirgranth Shramans (detached ascetics), and to listen to their 
discourses, the righteous thoughts of Somil were gradually replaced by unrighteous 
thoughts and with passage of time, he succumbed to falsehood to become an 
unrighteous person devoid of devotion. 
Commentary- Only a brief account about Somil Brahmin is given here with an 
advise to refer to Vyakhyaprajnapti, for greater details about his queries. 
Here it should be understood that Somil Brahmin mentioned in Bhagavati Sutra is in 
fact a different person and not the one mentioned here. Somil mentioned here is a resident 
of Varanasi and he asks questions from Bhagavan ParshvaNath, whereas Somil of 
Bhagavati Sutra is a resident of Vanijyagram and he asks questions from Bhagavan 
Mahavir. However, as the names and questions asked are similar it has been advised here 
to refer to Bhagavati Sutra for more details. Some of the important questions under 
reference and their answers are as follows— 
Bhante ! How is your journey ? 
To pursue austerities(tap) codes(niyam) discipline (samyam) selfstudy (svadhyaya), 
meditation (dhyan), associations (yoga) with essential duties (avashyak) is my journey. 
Bhante ! What are your restraints (yaapaniya)? 
Restraints (yaapaniya) is of two kinds. To have complete control over the sense 
organs including that of hearing is my (1) restraint over senses (indriya yaapaniya)"". I 
have completely rooted out all the four passions including anger; this is my (2) restraint 
other than that over senses (noindriya yaapaniya). 
Bhante ! What is the meaning of 'unrestricted' in your context? 
In my case physical disorders caused by the three body humors, air (vaat), bile 
(pitta), and phlegm (cough) have been completely pacified.

***** 
meaning of 'unrestricted' in my context is this state of bliss `unrestricted' by body. 
Bhante! What is your defined movement and stay (prasuk vihar)? 
To move and stay in areas and places that are free of women, animals, 
eunuches, and other such faults is my defined movement and stay (prasuk vihar). 
Bhante ! Is Sarisava edible (bhakshya or usable or acceptable) for you or not? 
It is edible and inedible both. 
Q. Why do you say that ? 
Ans. Sarisava (sadrashvaya or of same age) friend is unacceptable (abhakshya) and 
Sarisava (Sarason or mustard) seeds are edible (bhakshya). 
Bhante ! Is Maas edible or not? 
Maas in its literal meaning of months (like Shravan), measure of gold or silver is of 
no use (abhakshya). However, one of its interpretation is only Maash (Udad; a kind of pulse;) 
that too free of living organism and taken as alms. It is edible (bhakshya), others are not. 
Bhante ! Is Kulattha edible for you or not? 
The word kulattha has two meanings—noble woman and Kulathi (horse-bean; 
The beans are edible if free of living organism and taken as alms. Others are not. 
Q  Are you one or many? 
Physically I am one that is soul. In terms of modes I am two that is knowledge 
and perception. In terms of application or activities of past, present, and future I am 
many. (Bhagavati Sutra,) 
Similar questions and answers also feature in the story of Shailak Rajarshi in 
Jnata dharma kathanga,  
Meaning-  One midnight while pondering over his family circumstances, Somil 
Brahmin thought—""I am a resident of Varanasi city and belong to a very high caste Brahmin 
family. I have accepted vows (traditional rituals and codes), studied Vedas, married and brought 
a wife home, got sons and daughters for extending the family lineage, acquired wealth, 
sacrificed animals for yajna, performed elaborate yajnas, offered gifts to Brahmins, holioured 
and worshiped guests, offered sacrifice to fire, installed yupas (ritual pillar in a yajna), and 
performed many other such deeds required of a householder. 
But now I feel that tomorrow when the sun is at its full glow I should arrange to 
plant numerous orchards of mango trees. In the same way I should arrange for planting 
gardens of Matuling  (Bijaura, a kind of lemon),  Bilva (Bel; timb;),  Kavittha (Kaith; Feronia) 
Chincha (Imli; tamarind) and other flowering plants outside Varanasi city. According to 
what he thought, next morning he started planting many mango-orchards... and so on up 
to... flowering plants outside Varanasi city. 
Having the required protection from animals and birds as well as strong winds 
and with proper watering and nurturing, these gardens, in due course, turned beautiful 
and appealing. These gardens looked enchanting due to their dark hue like that of 
beautiful grand clouds and deep green glow of leaves, flowers, and fruits. They became 
highly delightful due to their radiant dense greenery. 
Later, some other midnight, while pondering over his family circumstances, Somil 
Brahmin thought—""I am a resident of Varanasi city and belong to a very high caste Brahmin 
family. I have accepted vows (traditional rituals and codes), studied Vedas, ... and so on up

to... installed yupas (ritual pillar in a yajna), and after that I have planted many mango-
orchards... and so on up to... flowering plants outside Varanasi city. But now I feel that 
tomorrow when the sun is at its full glow I should arrange to get made numerous cooking 
pans and spoons of iron and utensils of copper suitable for tapasas (hermits). Also I should 
get large quantities of ashan, paan, khadya, svadya (staple food, liquids, general food, and 
savoury food) cooked. Having done that I should invite my friends, family members, relatives 
and acquaintances; greet them; offer them this food;and honour them with clothes, 
perfumes, garlands, and ornaments. After that, in their presence I should hand over the 
responsibility of the family to my eldest son. Then after seeking permission from them 
and my eldest son, and carrying the iron and copper utensils, I should go to the tapasas 
(hermits) who have renounced their homes and are living on the banks of river Ganges. 
Those tapasas (hermits) include—Hotrak (those who do offerings at fire sacrifice); 
Potrak (the clad ones); Kautrik (those who sleep on the ground); Yajnik (those who perform 
yajna or ritual sacrifice); Shraaddhakin (those who perform rituals for the benefit of deceased 
relatives); Sthaalakin (those who carry plate or thaali and other pots); Humbauttha (those 
dwelling in jungle); Dantodukhalik (those who remove husk from grain with their teeth before 
eating); Unmajjak (those who bathe by taking just one dip in water); Sammajjak (those who 
wash their hands and feet repeatedly); Nimajjak (those who remain under water for some 
time); Samprakshalak (those who cleanse their body by rubbing sand or clay); Dakshin-koolak 
(those who live on the southern bank of the Ganges); Uttar-koolak (those who live on the northern 
bank of the Ganges); Shankhadhma (those who take their meals after blowing conch-shell); 
Kooladhma (those who take their meals on the bank after shouting loudly); Mrigalubdhak (those 
who subsist on deer-meat); Hastitapas (those who subsist on elephant-meat);  
Uddandak (those who move about raising their staff); Dishaprokshi (those who sprinkle 
water in all directions for worship); Valkavasi (the bark-clad); Bil-vasi (those who dig holes and 
live in them); Jal-vasi (those who live in water); Vrikshamoolak (those who live under trees); Jal-
bhakshi (those who subsist only on water); Vayubhakshi (those who subsist only on air); 
Shaivalabhakshi (those who subsist on moss or grass only); Moolahari (those who subsist on 
roots only); Kandahari (those who subsist on bulbous roots); Tvachahari (those who subsist on 
bark of a plant); Patrahari (those who subsist on leaves); Pushpahari (those who subsist on 
flowers); Bijahari (those who subsist on seeds); those who subsist on naturally fallen or 
detached bulbous roots, roots, bark, leaves, flowers, and fruits; those who develop 
endurance for water by regularly pouring water on their bodies; and those who mortify their 
bodies by five fires (burning four pyres on four sides and considering sun to be the fifth) as if 
cooking on burning coal or roasting in hot sand. 
Of these tapasas (hermits) I would like to get initiated with the Dishaprokshiks (who 
sprinkle water in all directions for worship). After getting initiated I will take this rigorous 
resolve—""I will observe a lifelong vow of continuous two day fasts ( two day fast followed by 
a day of eating and again followed by a two day fast and so on). While doing this I will perform 
the Disha-chakraval practice mortifying my body enduring heat of the sun with raised 
arms in the heat-mortification arena."" Deciding thus, at dawn (next morning) he took along 
many iron, other utensils and got initiated as a Dishaprokshik hermit. Immediately on 
initiation he took aforesaid resolve and moved about commencing the first two day fast.

            Commentary- Explaining the Disha-chakraval practice Means- For breaking 
fast in this practice aspirant collects fruits and places in four directions of the arena of 
practice. At proper time he breaks his first fast eating the fruits placed in east direction. 
Second, third and fourth fasts are broken by eating fruits placed in south, east, north 
directions respectively. The practice in which fast is broken following this sequence is 
called Dishachakraval practice. [For detailed description of hermits See- Aupapatik]. 
 (Post-initiation) On the day he was to break his first two day fast that Somil Brahmin 
stepped down from the heat-mortification arena. He then put on his bark-garments and came 
to his hut. He took a bamboo basket and a pole to carry it. After worshipping and sprinkling 
water in the east he uttered—""O honoured Soma, the guardian angel of the east, please 
protect me, Somil Brahmarshi, on the spiritual path and permit me to take whatever bulbous 
roots, roots, bark, leaves, flowers, fruits, seeds, and green vegetables as well as grass that are 
available in the east."" With these words Somil Brahmarshi went towards east and collected 
whatever bulbous roots, roots, and so on up to... grass he could find and put them in the 
basket. He also collected some grass, some leaves by bending branches, and some fire-
wood. He then returned to his hut. He placed the basket and the pole on the ground. Now he 
made a clean platform and plastered it with cow-dung and other purifying things.  
After sprinkling water over that spot he took the grass and a pitcher, walked to the 
Ganges and entered it. He washed his body clean in the river water and played around in the 
river to soak his body. After washing his mouth and getting absolutely pure, he made offerings 
of water to deities and his ancestors. After this ritual he came out of the Ganges carrying the 
grass and the pitcher and returned to his hut. Back in the hut, he prepared a sacrificial platform 
with grass and sand. Taking the fire-wood he prepared two pieces of wood, one with a hole 
and the other pointed to fit in the whole. With the help of these two pieces of wood he made 
fire and inflamed it by adding fire-wood. Once the pyrewas ready he installed seven things 
on its right-hand side 
 
[6] Meaning- (1) Sakth (aninstrument), (2) Valkal (bark garment), (3) Sthaan 
(aasan; seat or mattress), (4) Shayya-bhaand (bed and utensils), (5) Kamandalu (gourd-
bowl), (6) wooden staff, and (7) one's own body.  
[7] Meaning- Installing these seven things he offered honey, butter-oil, and rice 
into the pyre and offered sacrifice with the urn. He performed the daily yajna and 
worshipped guests (offered food to guests). At last he himself accepted food. 
Somil Brahmin then commenced his second two-day fast. He broke the second two-
day fast following the aforesaid procedure. The only change was that this time he faced 
south and uttered—""O honoured Yama, the guardian angel of the south, please protect me, 
Somil Brahmarshi, on the spiritual path and permit me to take whatever bulbous roots, 
roots,... and so on up to... grass are available in the south."" With these words Somil 
Brahmarshi went towards the south. 
Somil Brahmarshi then commenced his third two-day fast. He broke the third two-
day fast following the aforesaid procedure. The only change was that this time he faced 
west and uttered--""0 honoured Varun, the guardian angel of the west, please protect me, 
Somil Brahmarshi, on the spiritual path and permit me to take whatever bulbous roots, 
roots,... and so on up to... grass are available in the west."" With these words Somil *****

day fast following the aforesaid procedure. The only change was that this time he faced 
north and uttered—""O honoured Vaishraman, the guardian angel of the north, please 
protect me, Somil Brahmarshi, on the spiritual path and permit me to take whatever 
bulbous roots, roots, ... and so on up to... grass are available in the north."" With these 
words Somil Brahmarshi went towards the north. He then continued the aforesaid 
procedure he had followed on the first breaking of fast up to... At last he himSelf accepted 
food. details of the procedure for all the four directions are same as those of east.       
Later, some other midnight, while pondering over his ephemeral state, Somil 
Brahmin thought—""I am Somil Brahmarshi, a resident of Varanasi city and belonging to 
a very high caste Brahmin family. I have accepted vows (traditional rituals and codes)... 
and so on up to... installed yupas (ritual pillar in a yajna). After that I have planted many 
mango-orchards... and so on up to... flowering plants outside Varanasi city. And then I 
got made numerous cooking pans and spoons of iron. I handed over the responsibility 
of the family to my eldest son. Then after seeking permission from friends and my eldest 
son, and carrying the iron and copper utensils, I got tonsured and initiated as a hermit. 
After getting initiated I commenced the Disha-chakraval practice observing the austerity 
of continuous two-day fasts. 
""But now I feel that tomorrow when the sun is at its full glow I should bid farewell to 
the many tapasas (hermits) who are beyond my vision, or those who have been my 
companions of my pre-hermit and post-hermit states. I should greet and honour with words 
the hundreds of residents of the hermitage, seek their permission, put on bark-garments, 
place my utensils and other possessions in the basket of the sling-pole, cover my mouth 
with a strip of wood, face northwards and depart towards north for the great journey 
(journey unto death)."" Thus thought Somil. 
Thinking thus and following his resolve Somil Brahmarshi, after dawn the next 
morning, bade farewell to the many tapasas (hermits) who had met him, were known to 
him and were his companion. Seeking their permission and gratifying hundreds of 
residents of the hermitage... and so on up to... covering his mouth with a strip of wood 
he took this vow—""It would not be proper for me to (I resolve not to) get up from a place 
where I slip or otherwise fall while walking, irrespective of it being water, land, difficult 
terrain, a depression, a hill, uneven ground, a ditch, or a cave."" Thus he took a resolve. 
Then Somil Brahmarshi faced northwards and moved towards north for the great 
journey (journey unto death). While walking he arrived near an excellent Ashoka tree in the 
afternoon (third quarter of the day). He placed his basket and sling-pole under that Ashoka 
tree. Then he made a clean platform and plastered it with purifying pastes. After that he took 
the grassand a pitcher, walked to the Ganges, and like Shiva Rajarshi took his bath and 
performed other rituals. He then came out and returned to the Ashoka tree. Back there, he 
prepared a sacrificial platform with grass and sand. Taking the fire-wood he prepared two 
pieces of wood and with their help made fire and inflamed it by adding fire-wood. After 
performing all other rituals including the offerings to fire (as already mentioned) he covered his 
mouth with a strip of wood, took the vow of silence and sat down.

Commantary- This aphorism describes the great journey of Somil Brahmarshi, the 
journey preparatory to death. There is a mention of entering the Ganges and taking bath like 
Shiva Rajarshi. The detailed story ofShiva Rajarshi is narrated in Bhagavati,. He was ruler of 
Hastinapur. Like Somil he too renounced his kingdom and got initiated as a Dishaprokshik 
hermit. While performing aforesaid practices he acquired Vibhanga Jnana (pervert knowledge). 
With the help of this Vibhanga Jnana his vision expand up to oceans. He then approached 
Bhagavan Mahavir to remove his doubts. Once his doubts were removed he got initiated as 
an ascetic and after destroying all karmas through intense austerities attained nirvana. 
The technical terms used here have been explained by the commentator 
(Tikakar) as follows— 
Kaasth Mudra- it is a small strip of wood having tie-holes at both ends It is tied on the 
face with strings passing through holes to cover mouth. Tc cover one's mouth with it indicates 
that he has taken a vow of strict silence 
Sharak- This is a type of wood which when rubbed with arani (anothel type of 
wood) gives sparks to make fire. 
Mahaprasthan- the vow of rigorous conduct accepted with the purposf of embracing 
death is called mahaprasthan path or the great journey. 
Meaning- Then one midnight a god appeared.before &mil, Brahrriarshi and said 
to him- “O Somil Brahmin! The praxis you have accepted is a bad praxis?’ The god 
uttered these Words a second and a third tine also. But Somil Brahmarshi gave no heed 
to his words and remained silent.Realizing it to be neglect and disrespect the god 
returned in the direction from which he came. 
Next  morning at dawn bark-garment clad Somil took his baskets and pole as 
well as other possessions, covered his mouth with wooden strip, moved towards north. 
While walking he arrived near a Saptaparna tree in the afternoon (third quarter of the day). 
He placed his basket and pole under that Saptaparna tree. Then he made a clean platform and 
plastered it with purifying pastes. After that he performed all what he had done imder the Ashoka 
tree and finally after offerings to fire he covered his mouth with a strip of wood and sat down. 
Then at midnight a god appeared before Somil Brahmarshi and, as done earlier under 
Ashoka tree, said to him—""O Somil Brahmin ! The praxis you have accepted is a bad praxis."" 
But Somil Brahmarshi gave no heed to his words and remained silent. Once again the god left. 
Next morning (the third day) at dawn bark-garment clad Somil took his baskets 
and pole as well as other possessions, covered his mouth with the wooden strip and 
moved towards north. 
Thus on the third day while walking he arrived near an excellent Ashoka tree in the 
afternoon (third quarter of the day). He placed his basket and pole under that Ashoka tree. 
Then he made a clean platform. After that he took the grass and a pitcher, walked to the 
Ganges and took his bath and performed other rituals. He then came out and returned to the 
Ashoka tree. Back there, he prepared a sacrificial platform. After offerings to fire he covered

At dawn bark-garment clad Somil took his baskets and pole as well as other 
possessions, covered his mouth with the wooden strip and moved towards north. 
On the fourth day while walking Somil Brahmarshi arrived near a banyan tree in the 
afternoon (third quarter of the day). He placed his basket and pole under that banyan tree. 
Then he made a clean platform and plastered it with cow-dung and clay.... and so on up 
to... he covered his mouth with a strip of wood, took the vow of silence and sat down. Then 
at midnight the same god appeared once again before Somil and, as earlier, said to him—

silent and the god left. 
At dawn when the sun became bright, bark-garment clad Somil took his baskets 
and pole as well as other possessions, covered his mouth with the wooden strip and 
moved towards north. 
On the fifth day of his great journey, Somil Brahmarshi arrived near an Udumbar 
(Gular; the wild fig; Ficus glomerata) tree in the afternoon (third quarter of the day). He placed his 
basket and pole under that wild big tree. Now he made a clean platform... and so on up to... 
he covered his mouth with a strip of wood, took the vow of silence and sat down. 
Then, at midnight the same god appeared once again before Somil and, as earlier, 
said to him—""0 Somil ! The praxis you have accepted is a bad praxis."" But Somil remained 
silent. The god uttered these words a second and a third time also—""0 Somil ! The praxis 
you have accepted is a bad praxis."" On this second and third utterance Somil asked the 
god—""Beloved of gods ! Why my praxis is bad praxis?” 
The god replied to Somil Brahmin—""Beloved of gods ! Earlier you had accepted the 
twelve-fold Shravak dharma' (code of laity) inclusive of five anuvrats (minor vows) and seven 
shikshavrats (instructive or Complimentary vows of spiritual discipline). (Deprived of opportunities to 
behold ascetics and to listen to their discourses, you succumbed to falsehood and abandoned the 
accepted Shravak dharma). Later, one midnight, while pondering over your family 
circumstances (you thought of getting made and carrying iron pans and spoons and copper utensils, 
going to hermits on the banks of the Ganges, and getting initiated as Dishaprokshik hermit) and so 
on."" The god narrated all what Somil had thought earlier and added—""Then you got initiated 
as Dishaprokshik hermit and in due course took a vow and. following it you came to an 
Ashoka tree placed your baskets and pole under it and made a clean platform, took a bath in 
the Ganges, offered sacrifice in fire, covered your mouth with a strip of wood, took the vow of 
silence and sat down. Then at midnight I appeared before you and advised—`0 Somil ! The 
praxis you have accepted is a bad praxis.' But you did not pay any heed and remained silent. 
In the same way I offered you advise for four days but you never paid any attention to what I 
said. Then today, the fifth day, you arrived near an Udumbar tree in the afternoon and placed 
your basket and pole under the tree. You cleaned the spot for sitting and plastered it. After 
offerings in fire you covered your mouth with a strip of wood, took the vow of silence and sat 
down. Therefore, 0 Beloved of gods ! The praxis you have accepted is a bad praxis."" 
On hearing these words from the god Somil Brahmarshi said—""0 Beloved of 
gods ! Please tell me how my bad praxis can become a good praxis ?"" 
The god replied to Somil Brahmin—""Beloved of gods ! If you, on your own, once 
again accept the Shravak dharrna (code of laity) inclusive of five anuvrats (minor vows)

After this the god paid homage and obeisance to Somil Brahmarshi and returned 
in the direction from which he had come. 
When the god left, Somil Brahmarshi, as advised by the god, once again 
accepted the five anuvrats (and all the twelves vows) that he had accepted in the past and 
commenced his spiritual journey. 
Somil lead his Shramanopasak (lay worshipper of Jain ascetics) life, enkindling his soul 
by observing a variety of austerities including many one day, two day, three day... and so on 
up to... fortnight long and month long fasts. In the end he took the ultimate vow (sallekhana) of 
a fortnight duration and observed a fortnight long fast (avoiding thirty meals). As he died 
without doing pratikraman (critical review) at the moment of his death, thereby transgressing 
the righteous code, his soul has reincarnated instantaneously (upapat) as Shukra, the king of 
Shukra Jyotishk gods, in the divine bed (with a minimum occupied space of uncountable fraction 
of an Angul and a maximum of seven cubits) covered with divine cloth in the Upapat-hall of 
Shukravatansak vimaan in the Shukra Mahagraha (great planet). 
Then Shukra Mahagraha god attained the state of full development (paryapti) 
through five kinds of full development (paryapti)... and so on up to... bhasha-man (speech

Concluding story Bhagavan Mahavir said—""Thus, Gautam! that Shukra Graha 
god acquired that divine opulence and power. His life span there is one Palyopam."" 
Gautam Swami again asked, ""Bhante ! Completing the age, state, and life of the

Introduction:- This fourth chapter of the third section is popularly known as 
Bahuputrika Devi. The story in this chapter is much longer as compared to the other 
chapters and is full of many interesting incidents. 
This chapter gives an important message—one should never have intense desire 
or infatuation for anything or pleasure. Infatuation always leads to misery. 
Chapter -3- Compiled by Muni DeepratnaSagar is finished

**** 
Bahuputrika suffered for three births due to her intense desire of bearing a child. 
In her birth as Subhadra Sarthavahi (wife of a caravan chief) she was sterile. Her 
desire for having a child increased when she saw other women with children. Even after 
getting initiated as an ascetic, her fondness for children inspired her to indulge in anti-
ascetic activities including fondling children, giving them a bath, and enjoying various 
games and other pastimes with them. She died without a critical review and atonement 
of these faults and reincarnated as a goddess to become famous as Bahuputrika Devi. 
In that birth also she had to create numerous children with her divine powers for the 
entertainment of Indra, the king of gods. From there she will reincarnate as Soma 
Brahmani. Not rid of the bondage of intense craving from the past birth, she would give 
birth to twins every year. Finally she will be the mother of thirty two children in sixteen 
years. Disturbed by the hardship of taking care and bringing up so many small kids she 
will get fed up and think—""It would have been better had I been sterile. Having many 
children makes me sad."" 
Thus in some past birth she was sad because of the unfulfilled desire of having 
children but in the birth under discussion she became sad because of more children. 
Thorns of intense craving tormented her for three births. 
The lesson of this chapter is that intense desire for means of mundane pleasures 
and comforts always leads to pain and sorrow. Also that as long as a person does not 
resort to critical review and atonement for the sins committed, he is not a true aspirant 
of the spiritual path irrespective of his following Shravak vrat (the code for laity) or the 
Sadhu vrat (ascetic-code). The transgressor of codes fails to attain a good birth. 
Therefore, one should try to do critical review and atonement for all his faults and 
endeavour to be a true aspirant free of the thorns of sinful deeds. 
[8] Meaning- After listening to third chapter, JambuSwami asked SudharmaSwami- 
“Bhante! When this is the text and meaning of the third chapter of Pushpika, as given by 
Shraman Bhagavan Mahavir, what is the text and meaning of fourth chapter of Pushpika?"" 
Arya Sudharma said—""Long lived Jambu ! It is as follows- 
During that period of time, there was a city called Rajagriha where there was a 
chaitya called Gunasheelak. The ruler of the city was King Shrenik. Once Swami 
(Shraman Bhagavan Mahavir) arrived. People came to attend religious discourse. 
During that period of time Bahuputrika Devi was sitting on a throne named 
Bahuputrik in Sudharma Sabha (divine assembly) of the Bahuputrik Vimaan (celestial 
vehicle) along with four thousand vehicles based goddesses and four thousand 
Mahattarika goddesses (teacher goddesses who taught ethics and morality). Like Suryabh 
god they were enjoying a variety of divine pleasures. Then with the help of her all 
pervading Avadhi Jnana she observed this whole Jambu continent. She saw Shraman 
Bhagavan Mahavir sitting in his Samavasaran (divine assembly of a Tirthankar) and got 
up from her throne. She (took seven-eight steps forward) paid homage, returned to her 
throne and sat facing east.(detailed description is same as SuryabhDev See- Rayapaseniya)  
She then, like Suryabh Dev, instructed her abhiyogik devs (attendant gods) to 
sound the melodious bell. They sounded the melodious bell to inform all gods and 
goddesses to come to pay homage to Bhagavan. After that she again instructed the

*****                                                                                                                        
attendant gods to create a vimaan (celestial vehicle) suitable for going to pay homage to 
Bhagavan. The commander followed the instructions and created a vimaan one 
thousand Yojan in area and sixty two and a half Yojans in height. Like Suryabh Dev she 
proceeded in the northward direction, created a one thousand Yojan tall vaikriya sharira 
(transmuted body) and came to Bhagavan's Samavasaran (divine assembly of Tirthankar). 
Bhagavan gave his sermon. When the discourse concluded, that Bahuputrika 
Devi paid homage to Bhggavan and extended her right arm to create one hundred eight 
young gods. Extending her left arm she also created 108 young goddesses. After that 
she also created numerous adolescents and children. Then like SuryabhDev she 
presented stage performance and returned (after paying homage to Bhagavan). 
When Bahuputrika Devi left, Gautam Swami asked Bhagavan Mahavir after 
paying homage and obeisance—""Bhante ! Where did the divine display of opulence and 
powers created by Bahuputrika Devi go and disappear?"" 
Bhagavan answered the question by giving the example of Kutagar- ""Gautam ! 
The divine display of opulence and powers created by Bahuputrika Devi was drawn into 
and disappeared within her own body. 
After that Gautam Swami asked—""Bhante ! How did that Bahuputrika Devi 
acquire that divine opulence and power? 
Shraman Bhagavan Mahavir replied—""Gautama! During that period of time there 
was a city named Varanasi. Outside the city was a Chaitya named Amrashalavan. In 
Varanasi lived a caravan chief (sarthavaha) named Bhadra who was very rich. The name 
of Bhadra Sarthavaha's wife was Subhadra. She had very delicate limbs and was very 
beautiful. But as she was sterile she did not give birth to even a single child. She was only 
the mother of her knees and elbow (this means that her breasts were touched only by her knees 
and elbows, not her child)."" 
One day while Subhadra was thinking about family matters an aspiration (ajjhatthiye or 
adhyatmik), expectation (patthiye or prarthit), notion (manogaye or manogat) and intention 
(sankappe or sankalp) surfaced—""I have been enjoying my married life with Bhadra 
Sarthavaha. However, I have not given birth even to a single boy or girl. Complete is the life as 
humans of those mothers and blessed, fortunate, and meritorious are those mothers who 
have given birth to a child; who breast-feed their own child who is eager to suckle, who 
sweetly stutters, and who in stupor shiftsfrom the base of the breasts toward the armpit; 
who have heard the sweet stutter of the child and comforted it by hugging; and who 
have lifted the baby with their tender and loving hands, placed it in the lap and enjoyed 
sweet and loving talk with the baby. But I am the wretched and ill-fated one that has 
been deprived of any of these pleasures of an offspring."" Depressed by these 
tormenting thoughts she spent a wretched life. 
During that period of time, wandering comfortably from one village to another, an 
aryaa (female ascetic) named Suvrata, arrived in the town of Varanasi. She was 
sincerely pursuing the practices of five samitis (regulations) prescribed for movement, 
speech, alms seeking, maintaining ascetic equipment including bowls, and excreta 
disposal. She also practiced the three guptis (restraints) of mind, speech, and body. She 
exercised complete restraint over sense organs (guptendriya). She practiced celibacy

with nine restraints (gupta brahmacharini). She was accompanied by a large family of 
scholarly female disciples. After seeking formal permission from the owner, she 
accepted bed and other necessary things and camped there enkindling her soul with 
spiritual activities related to inner discipline and austerities. 
Later while moving about to seek suitable alms from ordinary, middle, and high 
class families in Varanasi, a group of two-three aryikas (female ascetics) came to Bhadra 
Sarthavaha's house. When Subhadra Sarthavahi saw aryikas coming she was happy 
and pleased. She at once got up from her seat, went ahead seven-eight steps and paid 
homage to them. After availing the opportunity of giving ample ashan, paan, khadya, 
svadya ahaar (staple food, liquids, general food, savoury food) as alms she requested— 
""Aryaas ! I have been enjoying my married life with Bhadra Sarthavaha. 
However, I have not given birth even to a single child. Blessed, fortunate, and 
meritorious are those mothers... and so on up to... But I amthe wretched and ill-fated 
one that has been deprived of any of these pleasures of even a single offspring."" 
""Beloved of gods ! You are very wise and scholarly. You visit many villages, 
settlements near mines, cities, and countries. You go to houses of many kings, influential 
and rich persons, knights of honour, caravan chiefs, etc. to seek alms. Do you know of or 
have come across some such magical method, mantra, or medical treatment including 
Vaman (emesis), Virechan (purgation), Vastikarma (common anaema), medicines, 
formulations, etc. that may enable me to bear and give birth to a child."" 
At this those aryikas said to Subhadra Sarthavahi—""Beloved of gods ! We are 
Nirgranth Shramanis (female ascetics) who observe the conduct of five samitis 
(regulations) including irya samiti (regulation of movement), three guptis (restraints), 
complete restraint over sense organs and celibacy. It is not proper for us even to hear 
such talk, how can we preach such subject and act accordingly ? However, 0 Beloved 
of gods ! We can tell you about the Omniscient-propagated religion that includes charity, 
righteousness and much more. 
Subhadra Sarthavahi was happy and contented after listening to, contemplating 
over, and understanding the religious discourse by the aryikas. She went around the 
aryikas clockwise three times. Raising her joined palms and waving them near her 
forehead she paid them homage and obeisance. She then said—""Beloved of gods! I 
respect and believe the preaching of the Nirgranth (the Omniscient) and have faith and 
interest in it. What you have said is correct, true, and real. I want to embrace the 
Shravak Dharma (Jain religion’s Vow)."" 
The aryikas replied—""Beloved of gods ! Do as you please and avoid languor 
when doing a good deed."" 
Then Subhadra Sarthavahi formally accepted Shravak Dharma from those 
aryikas. After doing that she paid them homage and bid them farewell. 
Thus that Subhadra Sarthavahi became a Shramanopasika (devotee of 
Shraman) and spent her life observing Shravak Dharma. 
Once around midnight while Subhadra was thinking about family matters, she 
thought—""I have been enjoying my married life with Bhadra Sarthavaha. However, I 
have not given birth even to a single child. Therefore, now I feel that tomorrow at

sunrise it would be proper for me to seek permission from Bhadra Sarthavaha, go to 
Aryika Suvrata and get initiated after renouncing the household."" 
Accordingly in the morning she went to Bhadra Sarthavaha and joining her palms 
said—""Beloved of gods ! I have been enjoying my married life with you for many years 
but I have not given birth even to a single child. Now it is my desire that after getting 
your permission I will go to Aryika Suvrata and get initiated as an ascetic."" 
At these words from Subhadra, Bhadra Sarthavaha said— 
""Beloved of gods ! Please don't tonsure your head, renounce the household and 
get initiated immediately. Enjoy more mundane pleasures with me as before and get 
initiated by Suvrata Aryaa only later."" 
 ` 
Subhadra Sarthavahi did not accept these words of Bhadra Sarthavaha. Second 
time and third time also she insisted saying—""Beloved of gods! I want to get your 
permission and go to Aryika Suvrata to get initiated as an ascetic."" 
With all enticing and warning words, arguments, detailed explanations (prajnapti), 
narration of examples and incidents (sanjnapti), and persuasions (vijnapti) Bhadra 
Sarthavaha failed to dissuade Subhadra. Finally, out of compulsion, he unwillingly gave 
her permission to get initiated. 
After that Bhadra Sarthavaha arranged for (by instructing his servants) large quantities 
of staple food, liquids, general food, and savoury food and invited all his friends, kin-folk, 
family members, relatives and acquaintances. After feeding them he greeted and honoured 
them. Then Subhadra Sarthavahi took her bath, performed auspicious rituals and 
atonements and adorned herself with ornaments. She then rode a large palanquin carried 
by one thousand persons. Amidst the sound of musical instruments like trumpet, display of 
wealth and grandeur and surrounded by friends, kin-folk, family members, relatives and 
acquaintances shearrived, passing through Varanasi city, at the upashraya (place of stay 
for ascetics) of Suvrata Aryaa. The palanquin was stopped and she alighted from it. 
Bhadra Sarthavaha got down from his palanquin and escorted Subhadra 
Sarthavahi to the place where Suvrata Aryaa was. After paying homage and obeisance 
he submitted— 
""Beloved of gods ! I adore and love Subhadra, my wife. I have always cared and 
protected her from various ailments and torments caused by disturbed body humours—
air, bile and .phlegm. But, 0 Beloved of gods ! Disturbed by the fears of worldly 
existence and afraid of the miseries of life and death, she now wants to tonsure her 
head and get initiated by you. Therefore, 0 Beloved of gods ! I offer her to you as a 
disciple-donation. Kindly accept this disciple-donation. 
At this request by Bhadra Sarthavaha, Suvrata Aryaa said—""Beloved of gods ! 
Do as you please and avoid languor when doing a good auspicious deed."" 
Subhadra Sarthavahi was pleased and contented at hearing these words from 
Suvrata Aryaa. She (went aside and) discarded her householder's dress, garlands and 
ornaments (and put on the white ascetic-garb). Pulling out all hair from her head 
(formally termed as five-fistful pulling out of hair) she approached Suvrata Aryaa. After 
going around her three times and paying homage she said—                                      .  .

cumbersome objects to take out and keep safe. In the same way I will protect my soul, 
which I very much adore, desire, love, covet, and approve, in such a way that no harm is 
caused to it by heat, cold, hunger, thirst, thief, snake, lion, wasp, mosquito and ailments 
caused by disturbed wind, bile, and phlegm."" Uttering these words as Devananda said to 
Bhagavan Mahavir (See-Bhagavati Sutra), she got initiated by Suvrata Aryaa. She became a 
completely celibate aryaa observing five samitis (self regulations), three guptis (restraints). 
At some point of time after initiation, with feelings of fondness and attachment for 
them, Subhadra Aryaa developed love and affection for children of householders. She 
started searching and bringing a variety of things for these children. The things 
included—oil for massage, pastes for removing filth from body, potable water, henna 
powder and other colours to decorate their limbs, bracelets, collyrium (etc.), sandal-
wood, perfumed powder, toys, sweets, kheer (a pudding made of rice and milk), milk, 
garlands, and many other such things. Of these adolescents, kids, and babies of the 
householders, she would massage some with oil, rub pastes to some, give bath with 
clean water to some, paint legs and lips of some, apply collyrium to eyes of some, make 
arrow like figure with saffron at the center of the foreheads of some, and rock some in a 
rocker. She would also make some kids stand in a line and then make them stand apart 
for applying sandal-wood paste to some and perfumed powder to others. To some she 
would give dolls to play with, to some she would feed sweets and to some she would 
feed milk or kheer. She would take off garland from neck of some and shower flowers 
on them. Some she would place on both the legs and others on her thighs. She would 
lovingly cuddle and fondle babies lifting some on her legs, some in her arms, some on 
her waist, some on her back, some on her breasts, some on her shoulders, some on 
her head and some in her palms. Smooching them, she would sing lullabies to some 
and songs in loud voice to others. This way she spent her time with children, vicariously 
satiating her desire for a son, wish for a daughter, and craving for grandchildren. 
When Aryaa Suvrata saw all these anti-ascetic activities of Subhadra she warned—
""Beloved of gods ! we are Nirgranth Shramanis (female ascetics) and we are strictly celibate 
observers of Irya samiti (etc.). As such, we are not allowed to indulge in caring for and 
fondling children of householders. But inspired by feelings of fondness and attachment, 
love and affection for children of householders, you indulge in proscribed activities including 
massaging oil... and so on up to... satiating your desire for a son, grandson (etc.). 0 
Beloved of gods ! you should condemn this proscribed and disgraceful conduct and do the 
prescribed atonement."" 
Subhadra neither believed nor accepted these instructions and directions of 
Aryaa Suvrata. Defying and ignoring her instructions, she continued her adopted way of 
playing with children. 
            As a result of this the Nirgranth Shramanis of the group started reproaching her, 
criticizing her, proscribing her, and disdaining her. And they restrained her time and again 
from..indulging..in..prohibited..activities.                                                                                            
 
This reproaching... and so on up to... restrained her from indulging in prohibited 
activities by other Aryikas forced Subhadra to think, ""When I was a house-holder I had

these Aryikas used to respect me but not now. So it would be good for me to leave this 
group, led by Aryaa Suvrata, tomorrow itself and live independently in another 
upashraya (place of stay for ascetics)."" She resolved to do accordingly and the first thing 
she did in the morning was to abandon Suvrata Aryaa and shift to another suitable 
upashraya to live alone. 
Thus not heeding to censure by other aryikas Subhadra Aryaa became 
unrestrained, willful, and footloose in her fondness for and excessive indulgence in 
massaging the children of householders and other such sinful activities. She moved 
about satiating her desire for sons and grandsons. 
As time passed, distancing herself from ascetic virtues (pasattha) that Subhadra 
Aryaa became lax in her ascetic conduct (pasatth-vihari); breaking her vows she became 
vow-breaker; indulging in base activities (avsanna) she became disgraceful 
(avasannavihari); keeping contact with householders (samsakt) she became gregarious 
(samsaktavihari); and acting willfully she became footloose. This way she lived long as 
an ascetic. In the end she observed the ultimate vow of fifteen days duration to cleanse 
her soul of the dirt of karmas and abandoning thirty meals died without reviewing and 
atoning for her sinful misconduct. She reincarnated as Bahuputrika Devi, with a 
minimum occupied space of uncountable fraction of an Angul (and a maximum of seven 
cubits), on the divine bed covered with divine cloth in the Upapat-hall of Bahuputrika 
vimaan (celestial vehicle) in the Saudharm Kalp (divine dimension). 
Then Bahuputrika Devi instantaneously attained the state of full development (paryapti) 
through five kinds of full development (paryapti)... and so on up to... bhasha-man (speech and 
mind) paryapti and lived as a goddess. 
""Thus, Gautam ! that Bahuputrika Devi acquired that divine opulence and power. 
On listening to the description of her earlier birth Gautam Swami asked further—
""Bhante ! Why is that Bahuputrika Devi called Bahuputrika (having many offsprings) ? 
Bhagavan replied- ""Gautam ! Every time that Bahuputrika Devi goes to Shakra, king 
of gods, she creates many children and infants. After doing this she approaches Shakra, 
king of gods, seated on his throne and displays her divine power, opulence and influence. 
For this reason, Gautam ! that BahuputrikaDevi called Bahuputrika (having many offsprings). 
Gautam Swami--""Bhante 1 What is the life-span of Bahuputrika Devi in that 
divine realm ? 
Bhagavan—""Gautam ! Her life-span there is four Palyopam."" 
Gautam Swami again asked, ""Bhante ! Completing the age, state, and life of the 
dimension of gods and descending from that abode of gods, where will Bahuputrika 
Devi go? Where will she be born?” 
Bhagavan said, ""Gautam ! Completing the age, state, and life of the dimension of 
gods that Bahuputrika Devi will be born as a daughter in a Brahmin family residing in 
Vibhel village located at the foothills of Vindhyachal mountain in Bharatvarsh in the 
Jambudveep continent."" 
After eleven days of her birth, on the twelfth day, her parents will name her 
thus—""Our daughter should be called Soma.""

***** 
In due course Soma will cross adolescence and attain maturity (when awareness 
of worldly pleasures is gained). In her youth she will develop into an exquisite beauty 
having a body with perfect proportions and endowed with youth and charm. 
Then her parents will realize that she has crossed adolescence, is aware of 
worldly pleasures, and is a mature young woman. Consequently they will marry her to 
Rashtrakoot (with mutual consent), their bhanja (nephew; sister's son), and give enough 
household things, facilities, wealth and ornaments. 
Rashtrakoot will find Soma lovable, adorable, and beautiful. He will carefully 
protect her like a jewel box and a pot of oil. He will look after her like a wardrobe. He will 
take proper care of her like a box of gems. He will always be attentive to ensure that 
she is not tormented by cold, heat, ailments caused by disturbed body humours—wind, 
bile, and phlegm—and any other troubles. 
In due course that Soma Brahmani will enjoy a variety of worldly pleasures with her 
husband Rashtrakoot and give birth to twins every year for sixteen years making a total of 
thirty two children. Of these adolescents, children, and infants of different ages—some will 
sleep reverse on the bed, some will scream and shout, some will learn to walk, some will 
crawl to neighbouring courtyards, some will toddle around, some will fall on the ground, 
some will seek her breasts when they are hungry, some will search for milk, some will look 
for toys, some will look around for snacks, some will ask for meals, some will wander 
around for water or drinks, some will laugh, some will be upright and fretful, some  will be 
agitated and angry, some will quarrel with others to get back their things, some will 
beatothers, some will shout after being beaten, some will rush to catch others, some will 
cry, some will wail, some will sob, some will bawl, some will sleep, some will get scolded 
by touching something hot, some will bite others, some will vomit, some will pass stool, 
and some will urinate. Thus that Soma Brahmani will be ever smeared with stool, urine, 
and vomit and dressed in dirty rags. Due to her dull and dirty looks, and loathsome, 
stinking and repulsive appearance that Soma Brahmani will become unable and unfit to 
enjoy the desired worldly pleasures with her husband Rashtrakoot. 
In this distressed state, during the last quarter of a night, Soma Brahmini, while 
contemplating about family affairs, will think—""Encumbered by these numerous torturing 
and ill-fated adolescents, children, and infants of different ages born as twins after short 
gaps; of whom—some sleep reverse on the bed,... and so on up to... some urinate;ever 
smeared with stool, urine, and vomit; and with stinking and repulsive appearance I am 
not being able to enjoy the desired worldly pleasures with my husband Rashtrakoot. 
Therefore, as human beings fulfilled is the life of and blessed are those mothers who 
remain sterile. Being mother only to their breasts and knees (who care only for their 
breasts and knees and not an offspring) and unable to bear a child, they use perfumes and 
enjoy a variety of worldly human pleasures and comforts. But I am the wretched and ill-
fated one that has been deprived of any desired worldly pleasures with my husband."" 
During that period of time (when Soma will think thus), wandering comfortably from 
one village to another (following the conduct defined by Tirthankars), an aryaa (female 
ascetic) named Suvrata, sincerely pursuing the practices of five samitis (regulations)... 
and so on up to... accompanied by a large family of scholarly female disciples, will arrive

in Vibhel village. After seeking formal permission according to the ascetic conduct she 
will camp there. 
Later while moving about to seek suitable alms from ordinary, middle, and high 
class families in Vibhel village, a group of two-three aryikas (female ascetics) will come to 
Rashtrakoot's house. Soma Brahmani will be happy and pleased to see the aryikas 
(female ascetics) coming. She will at once get up from her seat, take seven-eight steps 
forward and pay homage to them. After availing the opportunity of giving ample ashan, 
paan, khadya, svadya ahaar (staple food, liquids, general food, and savoury food) as alms 
she will submit-  
""Aryaas ! Enjoying a variety of worldly pleasures with my husband Rashtrakoot I 
gave birth to one twin every year for sixteen years making a total of thirty two children. 
Of these adolescents, children, and infants of different ages—some sleep reverse on 
the bed, ... and so on up to... and some urinate. Due to being ever smeared with stool, 
urine, ... and so on up to... stinking and repulsive appearance I am unable to enjoy the 
desired worldly pleasures with my husband Rashtrakoot. Therefore, 0 Aryaas I wish to 
listen to your religious discourse."" 
At this request from Soma those aryaas (female ascetics) will preach austerities, 
discipline and other different aspects of the religion propagated by Tirthankars. 
Soma Brahmani will be happy and contented after listening to, contemplating 
over, and understanding the religious discourse by the aryikas (female ascetics). She will 
pay them homage and obeisance. Therafter she will say—""Beloved of gods ! I respect 
and believe the preaching of the Nirgranth (the Omniscient) and have faith and interest in 
it. I want to embrace it. 0 Aryaas ! What you have said is correct, true, and real. I will 
request my husband Rashtrakoot. Seeking his permission I would like to get initiated by 
you after getting my head tonsured."" 
The aryikas (female ascetics) will reply—""Beloved of gods! Do as you please and 
avoid languor when doing a good deed."" 
Then Soma Brahmani will pay them homage and bid farewell to the aryikas.  
Then that Soma Brahmani will go to Rashtrakoot and raising her joined palms to her 
forehead shall say—""Beloved of gods ! I have listened to religious discourse by aryikas (female 
ascetics) and found it suited to my liking and interest. Therefore, 0 Beloved of gods! After getting 
your permission I would like to go to Aryika Suvrata and get initiated as an ascetic."" 
At these words from Soma Brahmani, Rashtrakoot will say-  
""Beloved of gods ! Please don't tonsure your head, renounce the household and 
get initiated immediately. Enjoy more mundane pleasures and comforts with me as 
before and get initiated by Suvrata Aryaa only when you have had enough."" 
(After accepting this advise from Rashtrakoot) Soma Brahmani will take her bath, ... and 
so on up to... surrounded by a group of maid servants come out of her house. She will arrive, 
passing through Vibhel village, at the upashraya (place of stay for ascetics) of Suvrata Aryaa. 
After paying homage an obeisance to Suvrata Aryaa she will commence her worship. 
Then Suvrata Aryaa will preach to Soma Brahmani austerities, discipline and other 
different aspects of the religion propagated by Tirthankars including—a being is trapped in 
bondage due his deeds and gets liberated by shattering the shackles of karmas through his

own endeavour only (etc.). After listening to that discourse, Soma Brahmani will accept the 
twelve fold Shravak Dharma (Jain code for laity). After paying homage and obeisance to 
Suvrata Aryaa she will return home. 
Then that Soma Brahmani will become a Shramanopasika (Jain lay woman) 
endowed with the knowledge of fundamentals like being and non-being. She will spend her 
life enkindling her soul (by observing various vows including codes of uprightness, restraints that 
reinforce the practice of minor vows, abandoning and atoning for sinful deeds, living as ascetics for 
short periods and fasting). 
In due course that Suvrata Aryaa will leave Vibhel village and wander around in 
other populated areas. 
After that at some later period wandering comfortably from one village to another 
Aryaa Suvrata will once again come to Vibhel village. On getting the news of arrival of 
aryikas (female ascetics) Soma Brahmani will be pleased and contented. Taking her 
bath, adorning her with a variety of ornaments and accompanied by many maid 
servants as before, she will go to pay homage to Suvrata Aryaa. After paying homage 
and obeisance to Suvrata Aryaa and listening to her discourse she will say- 
""Seeking permission from my husband Rashtrakoot I wish to get initiated by you 
after getting my head tonsured."" 
Suvrata Aryaa will reply—""Beloved of gods ! Do as you please and avoid languor 
when doing a good deed."" 
Then Soma Brahmani will pay homage and obeisance to Suvrata Arya and return 
home to her husband Rashtrakoot. Joining her palms she will ask—""Beloved of gods ! 
Seeking your permission I want to get initiated as an ascetic."" 
To this Rashtrakoot will reply—""Beloved of gods ! Do as you please and avoid 
languor when doing a good deed."" 
After that Rashtrakoot will arrange for large quantities of staple food, liquids, 
general food, and savoury food and invite all his friends, kin-folk, family members, 
relatives and acquaintances. After feeding them he will greet and honour them... and so 
on. As Subhadra Sarthavahi got initiated in the previous birth, Soma Brahmani will also 
get initiated and will spend her life as a completely celibate aryaa (female ascetic) 
observing five samitis (self regulations) and three guptis (restraints). 
After that Soma Aryaa will live with Suvrata Aryaa and study eleven Angas (the 
primary canons or the main corpus of the Jain canonical texts) including Samayik. After this 
study she will lead ascetic life for many years enkindling her soul by observing a variety of 
austerities including fasting for two, three, four, five, six, and more days. In the end she 
will take the ultimate vow (sallekhana) of one month duration and avoiding sixty 
mealsembrace meditational death after doing pratikraman (critical review) at the moment 
of her death. She will reincarnate as a Samanik (of equal status) god of Shakra, the king 
of gods (in the first heaven). 
There the life-span of some gods is two Sagaropam (a metaphoric unit ) of time). 
life-span of that Soma Dev will also be two Sagaropam (a metaphoric unit of time).(On

During that period of time there was a city called Rajagriha. There was a chaitya 
called Gunasheelak. The ruler of the city was King Shrenik. Shraman Bhagavan 
Mahavir arrived. People came out to pay homage and attend discourse. 
During that period of time, like Suryabh Dev, Purnabhadra god wassitting on a 
throne named Purnabhadra in the Sudharma assembly in Purnabhadra Viman (celestial 
vehicle) in Saudharma Kalp Devlok (divine dimension) with four thousand vehicle based 
gods... and so on up to... Then with the help of his Avadhi Jnana (extrasensory knowledge

Mahavir stationed at Gunasheelak Chaitya. He came to Bhagavan, gavethirty two 
types of stage performances as Suryabh god had done andreturned after paying 
homage to Bhagavan. 
Then Gautam Swami asked Bhagavan Mahavir about disappearance of divine 
opulence and powers of that god. Bhagavan answered the question by giving example 
of Kutagar Shala . After that to the question  about his past birth Bhagavan replied- 
""Gautam ! During that period of time in this Jambudveep continent in Bharat area 
there was a grand and prosperous city named Manipadika. The ruler of the city was 
King Chandra. In the city there was a beautiful garden named Tarakeern. In Manipadika 
city lived a noble householder (gathapati) named Purnabhadra who was very rich. 
During that period of time some learned Sthavir Bhagavants (senior ascetics), who 
belonged to high castes and families and were free of any ambition for life as well as 
fear of death, came to Manipadika city with a large family of disciples. Masses gathered 
to attend their religious discourse.                                                                                    .

The only exception is that in earlier birth Datt was born in Chandana city, Shiva in 
Mithila city, Bala in Hastinapur city, and Anadrit in Kakandi city. 
The names of the chaityas of these cities should be taken from the Sangrahani

◙ Something about This Publication ◙ 
 
 
We have already published 45 Aagams in Four languages Prakrut, 
Sanskrut (Satik), Hindi and Gujarati.  Now a day for new generation & abroad 
living people, English translation has become a necessity.  So we have 
planned to translate or compile Jain-Aagam in English. We gave priority to 
Nandi Sootra because it’s known as wellbeing & auspicious sootra. The 
Theme of Nandi is knowledge; Nandi-sootra mainly describes five types of 
“ज्ञान-(Jnanas)”. 
 
Nandi-sootra is an “Ang-bahya”Aagam, at present it is known as 
“Chulika” Sootra. The author of Nandi-sootra is DEV-VACHAK GANI. Shree 
Malaygiri & Haribhadra-suri has written Vrutti [commentary] on Nandi-Sootra. 
A churni is also published on Nandi-sootra. 
 
Here, we have compiled Translation done by Shreechand Surana, 
which is originaly edited and translated in to Hindi by Shree Amar-Muni. We 
have two motives for publishing this book.—[1] To provide Aagam literature in 
English & [2] It should be given in Microsoft Word format so people can do 
Cut, Paste & Editing by themselves also. 
 
At present this Book is published as a Net-Publication with the help 
ofthe Jain Education International organization of America.  In future we may 
publish it as a Book also. We are also planning to put more Aagams in English 
before you. 
 
We also invite learned persons to translate more & more ‘authentic Jain 
litrature’ in English for kids and youths, so the ignorant-people of regional 
languages can also read or learn our “Shashtra & Granth”. 
 
We are very much thankful to Shree Pravinbhai, Sudeshbhai, 
Sangeetaben, Late Mr. Krupal Shah and all other known-unknown persons 
who helpd us for this project directly or indirectly.

…NANDI SOOTRA (Mool with Commentary)… 
✻PRAISE✻ 
THE PRAISE OF THE ARHAT (अरहंत) 
[001]MEANING -Victory to the knower of all the species of beings, the 
ultimate teacher, the source of bliss, the lord of the universe, the kin of all beings, the 
ancestor of all ancestors 
COMMENTARY -That which is ever changing and dynamic is called jagat 
(world). That where five types of astikaya (fundamental entities like matter, space, 
life etc.) including diva (living being) and dharmastikaya (motion or physical 
dynamism) always exist is called jagat. That which has chetana (senses) is called 
jina. 
There are six classes of living beings - earth-bodied, water-bodied, mobile-
bodied etc. The genus into which these beings are born is called yoni such as - deva 
(देव-god) yoni, manushya (human) yoni, tiryanch (animal) yoni etc. One of the 
adjectives for Arihant Bhagavan is the knower of the place of origin of all matter and 
life. 
Here the meaning of the term guru is - one who imparts right knowledge of 
matter and life and the propagator and guide of dharma (religion, righteousness). 
Because of propagating the message of ahimsa and peace he is the source of bliss. 
The perpetuator of yoga-kshema is called naath (lord, protector). To obtain 
what is absent is called yoga and to secure what is obtained is called kshema. As 
the Arihant shows the method of acquiring and securing the unique samyagdarshan 
(right-perception), he is called naath. As he considers all beings just like him and 
wishes well-being of all selflessly he is called jagat-bandhu (brother of all). The 
eldest and the oldest individual in a family are called pitamah (grandfather); he 
always worries about the well-being of the family. As Arihant is the supreme 
benefactor of the whole universe, he is like a grandfather. As he is endowed with 
numerous grand spiritual attributes like jnana (knowledge) he is called Bhagavan. 
PRAISE OF MAHAVIR 
[002]MEANING-May sage Mahavir, the original source of all Shrut-jnana (the 
scriptures belonging to the oral tradition of Jains), the last of the twenty four 
Tirthankars and the guru (guide) of all universe be ever victorious. 
COMMENTARY -The literature created by the Ganadhars, on the basis of the 
words uttered by Tirthankars, is called Shrut-jnana (the knowledge acquired by 
listening). The founders of the religious ford are called Tirthankars. Bhagavan 
Mahavir was the last or the twenty-fourth Tirthankar of this descending or regressive 
cycle of time. 
[003]MEANING -May Bhagavan Mahavir, the illuminator of the universe with 
the divine light of Kewal-jnana (omniscience), the Jina (the conqueror of foes like 
attachment), the valorous (who is master of the self), who is worshipped by gods and 
demons alike and who is free of all dirt of karmas, ameliorate all. 
COMMENTARY -Meaning of the term `bhaddam' is `May you be benefitted' or 
to wish well of someone. However, a Tirthankar reaches the ultimate state of bliss or 
acquisition; he is the embodiment of well-being. Therefore, in the name of the 
Tirthankars this is the wish about our own amelioration or universal well-being.

PRAISE OF THE SANGH-CITY 
[004] MEANING -May the city-like sangh (religious organization) which has 
forgiveness and other virtues as its rows of gorgeous houses, which is abundant with 
scriptural knowledge as its valuable gems, which is crisscrossed by samyaktva (a 
specific state of righteousness where right perception and right knowledge start 
translating into right conduct) as its clean streets and which is protected by purity of 
conduct (observation of five great vows) as its impart, ameliorate you. 
PRAISE OF THE SANGH-WHEEL (संघचक्र) 
[005] MEANING -Obeisance to the wheel like sangh which has discipline as 
its hub, which has twelve austerities as its spokes and which has samyaktva as its 
radiant rim. May the unique wheel like sangh that is invincible to any opposition 
always be victorious? This disc-weapon-like sangh cuts the bonds of rebirth. 
COMMENTARY -A wheel or a circular form is eternally associated with 
motion. The motion of a vehicle also depends on its wheel (circular shape or a disc). 
As such a carrier is also allegorically called wheel or disc or chakra. Sangh or the 
religious organization is the carrier of the abstract and applied components of 
religion. It also overpowers obstacles and so it is called a weapon as well. 
As he owns the divine chakra (disc-weapon), an emperor who conquers the 
six continents is called a Chakravarti. In the same way Vasudev, the conqueror of 
three continents, is called Ardhachakravarti (half of the former). There are no 
disturbances in the proximity of the divine chakra. The ideal of beneficence of all that 
is inherent to the Sangh is the main reason for attributing the glory of Chakra to it. 
The hub of the disc like Sangh is discipline or samyam. There are seventeen 
types of samyam - five ashrav-viraman (avoidance of inflow of karmas), disciplining 
of five senses, subduing the four passions and refraining from indulgence in evil 
through mind, speech and body. 
This sangh-chakra has twelve-type austerity, such as observing fasts, as its 
spokes. The rim or circumference defined by the twelve spokes of austerity with 
discipline as the center is known as samyaktva. Here the three vital essential 
constituents of the wheel-like sangh have been defined. 
PRAISE OF THE SANGH-CHARIOT
(संघरस  )
 
[006] MEANING -The Sangh is like a gorgeous chariot that has celibacy and 
self-denial as its high furling flags, and austerity and discipline as its two fast horses. 
May the god-like sangh-chariot that reverberates with the sound of gong of self-study 
(five pronged) ameliorate all. 
PRAISE OF THE SANGH-LOTUS (संघ-पद्म) 
[007& 8] MEANING -How beautiful is this sangh-lotus! It rises above the 
slime and water that is karma, which is joined with the long tubular stalk that is 
scriptural knowledge, which has five stable stamens that are great-vows filled with 
pollen that are virtues and over which hum bumble-bees that are learned shravaks. 
May the enchanting sangh-lotus, which is in bloom always due to the rays of the sun 
that is Arihant Bhagavan and has a thousand petals that are shramans (ascetics), 
ameliorate all? 
PRAISE OF THE SANGH-MOON (संघ चंद्र) 
[009] MEANING -The sangh is like the pure white moon. This sangh-moon 
has antelope like signs of austerity and discipline. The eclipse of falsehood can 
 
NandiSootra 
 
Aagam- 44 -NandiSootra

never shadow it. May this sangh-moon, which is radiant with the light of samyaktva, 
bring victory to all? 
PRAISE OF THE SANGH-SUN (संघ सूर्य) 
[010] MEANING -The sangh is like the sun. Sun-like sangh has dimmed the 
twinkling of stars and planets that are the groups of dogmatic followers of falsehood. 
It is ever brilliant with the radiant fire of austerity. It is removing the darkness of the 
world by spreading the light of right knowledge. May this sangh-sun, which is the 
embodiment of discipline of senses and control of desires, ameliorate all. 
PRAISE OF THE SANGH-SEA (संघ समुद्र) 
[011] MEANING -The sangh is like a sea. It has perseverance in discipline as 
its  expansive shore, it is infested with self-study (pursuit of virtues) as its marine 
animals like crocodiles that consume smaller beings that are karmas. It is rich with 
pious thoughts or meditation that are its pearls and it is undisturbed by afflictions that 
are its marine beings. May such sangh-sea ameliorate all. 
PRAISE OF THE SANGH-MOUNTAIN (संघ मेरु) 
[012] MEANING -The sangh is like the Maha-mandar mountain. The base of 
this great mountain is made up of diamonds of right perception and which is free of 
cleavages like doubt. It has deep foundation of interest in fundamentals. It is 
embellished with the gems of dharma (virtues of character) and it has a golden girdle 
of virtues like magnanimity. 
[013] MEANING -It has out crops of rocks of the vows of subduing senses 
and mind. The lofty attitude of pursuit of virtues forms its cliffs. It has the Nandan 
forest (वन) of contentment which is filled with the fragrance of chaste disposition. 
[014] MEANING -It has beautiful caves of clemency (jiva-daya) where dwell 
the lion-like ascetics who overpower the deer-like antagonists. The metals of reason 
and theme add to its splendor. It abounds in herbs of twenty eight 'types of Labdhi 
(special skills, attainments or powers). There are caverns of discourse halls 
scattered around it. 
[015] MEANING -Pure streams of Samvar (to stop the inflow of karmas by 
controlling the desires) flow here. Pea-cock like shravaks dance here in ecstasy and 
sing hymns of five ultimate benefactors every moment. Echo of these musical 
sounds emanate from the caverns of discourse halls. 
[016] MEANING -The cliffs of the sangh-mountain are resplendent with the 
sparks of glory of the self-effacing ascetics who effuse with the virtue of humbleness. 
It is beautified by the wish-fulfilling trees that are the ascetics having basic and 
auxiliary attributes of asceticism. These trees are loaded with flowers and fruits of 
religious conduct (humbleness, forgiveness etc.). Jungle like clusters of these trees 
that are ascetics have become places of shelter for masses. 
[017] MEANING -The best of the gems, the right knowledge, appears like its 
highest peak made up of cat's-eye. I offer my humble obeisance to such Maha-
mandar mountain like sangh. 
COMMENTARY -This is a PRAISE of the Shri sangh or the religious 
organization giving it the metaphor of the great Meru Mountain (mythical). The 
details about this mountain as given in the scriptures are - It is located at the center 
of the Jambudvipa. It is one thousand Yojan (a linear measure) deep in the earth and 
ninety nine thousand Yojan high. Its girth has a diameter of ten thousand yojans. It 
has four large and beautiful forests (वन) - (1) Bhadrashal forest (it is at the ground 
 
NandiSootra 
 
Aagam- 44 -NandiSootra 
~ 8 ~ 
Compiled by- Deepratnasagar 
 
level all around the mountain), (2) Nandan forest (at a height of five hundred yojans 
from the ground level), (3) Somanas forest (at a height of 62, 500 yojans from 
Nandan forest, (4) Panduk forest (at a height of 35,000 yojans from Somanas forest). 
It has three sections filled with gold, silver and gems respectively. It has a peak forty 
yojans high. This is one of the highest mountains in the world. 
The metaphor of Meru Mountain given to sangh is like this - Right perception 
is its base. Discipline, self-control, codes and subduing of passions are its golden 
rocks. Sublime, pious pursuits are its high cliffs. Self-study, chaste disposition, 
contentment etc. are its forests that provide bliss to gods and human beings. Twenty 
eight types of labdhis (special skills, attainments or powers) including Amarsh (the 
healing touch) are the divine herbs found on this mountain.  
The ascetics are like wish-fulfilling trees. Pure streams of samvar (the level of 
purity of attitude where the inflow of karmas is blocked) flow here. As the Meru 
mountain remains unmoved and stable even in the midst of terrible hellish storms 
and deluge, so remains this religious organization of the Jina amidst the verbal tirade 
of the antagonists. 
✻PRAISE OF THE TWENTY FOUR JINAS✻ 
[018, 19] MEANING - I offer obeisance with reverence to these twenty four 
Tirthankars of this regressive cycle of time: 
[1] Rushabh, [2] Ajit, [3] Sambhav, [4] Abhinandan, [5] Sumati, [6] Padma- 
prabh, [7] Suparshva, [8] Chandraprabh, [9] Suvidhi, [10] Sheetal, [11] Shreyans, 
[12] Vasupujya, [13] Vimal, [14] Anant, [15] Dharma, [16] Shanti [17] Kunthu, [18] Ar, 
[19] Malli, [20] Munisuvrat, [21] Nami, [22] Nemi (Arishtanemi), [23] Parshva, and[24] 
Vardhaman. 
✻THE LIST OF GANADHARS✻ 
[020, 21] MEANING -There were eleven Ganadhars (principal disciples) who 
managed the organization established by Bhagavan Mahavir: 
1. Indrabhuti, 2. Agnibhuti, 3. Vayubhuti (these three were brothers), 4. Vyakt, 
5.Sudharma, 6.Manditputra, 7.Mauryaputra, 8.Akampit, 9.Achal Bhrata, 10.Metarya, 
and 11. Prabhas. 
COMMENTARY -The Teerth (ford of religion) is established by the 
Tirthankars who are absolutely detached and omniscient. The first step taken at the 
time of establishing the Teerth is to formally initiate the Gandhars. 
These are exceptionally talented individuals of their period. As soon as they 
are initiated they acquire the Ganadhar labdhi (a special power) which 
instantaneously expands their scriptural knowledge. 
They absorb the first utterance of the Tripadi (all knowledge compressed into 
three words) by the Tirthankars and, with the help of their sharp intelligence, expand 
it into the stream of much coveted scriptural knowledge. 
The work of translating the words into the chain of Agams is accomplished by 
the Ganadhars. In Bhagavan Mahavir's order there was eleven Ganadhars and 
nine Ganas (groups within the organization). 
The senior most or the first Ganadhar was Indrabhuti Gautam. The fifth 
Ganadhar was Sudharma who became the first head of the order after the nirvana of 
Bhagavan Mahavir. All the extant shramans (Jain ascetics) belong to the lineage of 
disciples of Ganadhar Sudharma.

THE GLORY OF THE ORDER OF MAHAVIR 
[022]MEANING -May the best and the universally beneficent religious order 
of Bhagavan Mahavir be victorious. The order that ever propagates the pious path of 
renunciation and leads to nirvana; reveals all the fundamentals (matter and life); 
reveals all forms and attitudes, and destroys evil path and the perversions of vile 
beliefs. 
✻OBEISANCE TO THE ERA-LEADERS✻ 
[023] MEANING -I pay homage to Sudharma Swami of the Agnivaishyayan 
gotra (clan), Jambu Swami of the Kashyap gotra, Prabhav Swami of the Katyayan 
gotra and Shayyambhav Swami of the Vats a gotra. 
COMMENTARY -After the founding of the religious ford by the Tirthankar the 
responsibility of the management of the religious order and organization rests with 
his principal disciples, the Ganadharas. The man who shoulders this responsibility 
after the nirvana of the Tirthankar is known as Pattadhar (Head of the Order). Nine of 
his chief disciples had attained omniscience and were liberated before the nirvana of 
Bhagavan Mahavir. In Pavapuri, Gautam Swami also became omniscient 
immediately after the nirvana of Bhagavan Mahavir. An omniscient, as a rule, is 
never a carrier of any tradition; as such, although alive, Gautam Swami did not 
become the head of the order. The responsibility of carrying on the religious tradition 
established by Bhagavan Mahavir came to Sudharma Swami making him the first 
Head of the Order. This is the PRAISE of the Acharyas belonging to the glorious 
lineage of heads of the order of Bhagavan Mahavir. 
Arya Sudharma Swami - Arya Sudharma Swami was born into a Brahman 
family of Agnivaishyayan gotra. The names of his mother and father were Bhaddila 
and Dhammil respectively and they lived in the Videh area. The period of his birth is 
estimated to be around 80 B.V.N. (Before Vir Nirvana) Extremely talented Sudharma 
received the traditional Vedic knowledge of fourteen subjects from his scholarly 
father and established himself as a front line Vedic scholar of his time. Sudharma got 
initiated with his five hundred disciples during the first post Kewal-jnana discourse of 
Bhagavan Mahavir on Vatshakh Shukla 11, 500 B.V. (Before the beginning of the 
Vikrarn era) at that time his age was fifty years. 
He got to spend three years with Bhagavan Mahavir and during this period, 
based on the Tripadi (tripod; the popular name given to the essence of Bhagavan 
Mahavir's discourse), he authored the twelve ragas which became the principal 
canons of the Jain tradition. Arya Sudharma had also taken over the control of the 
lineage of disciples of all the other Ganadhars by the time of Bhagavan Mahavir's 
nirvana. After remaining the Head of the Order for twelve years he attained 
omniscience in 12 A.N.M. (After the Nirvana of Mahavir) He got nirvana at the age of 
approximately one hundred years on Vaibharagiri hills near Rajagriha after observing 
a month long fast in 20 A.N.M. 
Arya Jambu Swami - The successor of Sudharma Swami as the Head of the 
Order was Jambu Swami. He was born in a wealthy merchant family of Rajagriha in 
16 B.V.N. (543 B.C.). The names of his father and mother were merchant 
Rishabhdatt and Dharini Devi respectively. When she conceived, mother Dharini had 
seen five divine dreams - 1. Smokeless fire, 2. a lotus-pond, 3. Farms with ripe 
harvest, 4. a white elephant with four tusks, and 5. A jambu fruit of best quality. In 
due course, when she gave birth to a son he was named Jambu Kumar. 
 
NandiSootra

He became detached after listening to a discourse of Sudharma Swami when 
he was sixteen years old. When he approached his parents to seek permission for 
getting initiated they tried to dissuade him but he remained firm on his resolve. As a 
last resort his mother requested him that if he fulfilled just one of her wishes, she will 
also get initiated with him. Jambu agreed with a condition that once her wish was 
fulfilled she would not create hurdles in his path. 
According to their wish the parents arranged for Jambu's marriage with eight 
beautiful and virtuous girls. Although he married - due to intense pressure from his 
parents - during his first night he gave such a touching spiritual discourse to his eight 
wives that they became detached from all mundane activities. 
A notorious thief, Prabhav, who had entered Jambu's house, also happened 
to listen to this discourse. This thief also got detached. Next morning Jambu took 
diksha (the process of getting initiated) from Sudharma Swami, who was in 
Rajagriha at that time, along with 527 persons including Prabhav and his fellow 
thieves (469 B.C.). 
This initiation ceremony was attended by the Magadh king Kunik and his large 
council of ministers besides the prominent citizens of Rajagriha. For twelve years 
Jambu remained under tutelage of Sudharma Swami and acquired profound 
knowledge of all the canons. After Sudharma Swami became omniscient Jambu 
succeeded him as the Head of the Order. Jambu became omniscient in 20 A.N.M. 
(449 or 450 B.V.) and got nirvana in 64 A.N.M. (405 B.V., 462 B.C.). Jambu Swami 
is believed to be the last omniscient of this cycle of time. 
Arya Prabhav Swami - Arya Prabhav Swami succeeded Jambu Swami as 
Head of the Order. He also was initiated by Sudharma Swami. He was a prince from 
the Vindhya area in western India, but as his father made the younger son the heir 
apparent, Prabhav left his kingdom and became a bandit. When he went to the 
house of Jambu with an intention to steal, he listened to the discourse of Jambu and 
had a change of heart. He then became an ascetic along with Jambu. He became 
the Head of the Order, Acharya, in the year 64 A.N.M. He had absorbed all the 
knowledge of the canons. He was the first Shrut Kevali in Mahavir's tradition. (Shrut 
Kevali is the person who has complete literal knowledge of all the Angas including 
the fourteen sublime ones.) He left his mundane body in the year 75 A.N.M. (395 
B.V., 451 B.C.). 
Arya Shayyambhav Swami - He was born in a Brahman family of Rajagriha 
belonging to Vatsa gotra. He was a profound scholar of the Vedas, but a conceited 
person. When among his disciples, Arya Prabhav did not find a capable and 
scholarly person suitable to take charge of the order; he looked around for someone 
from other schools. One day while he was busy in Yajna rituals Shayyambhav heard 
a comment from some shramans that no one present there had the knowledge of the 
fundamentals. This inspired the irked Shayyambhav to go to Arya Prabhav, the then 
head of the shramans, and find out if the shramans had the true knowledge of the 
fundamentals. Arya Prabhav gave him the knowledge of the fundamentals and made 
him a disciple. As Shayyambhav was already a brilliant scholar, Arya Prabhav 
imparted all the knowledge of the twelve Angas to him and made him the successor. 
At the time of his renunciation, Shayyambhav was twenty eight years old and 
his wife was pregnant. Therefore the father and the son were not acquainted with 
each other. The desire to experience the love of his father grew with age within the 
son's mind. However, at last when child Manak came to Shayyambhav in search of 
 
NandiSootra 
 
Aagam- 44 -NandiSootra 
~ 11 ~ 
Compiled by- Deepratnasagar 
 
his father, Shayyambhav did not reveal his identity but gave an impressive religious 
discourse. Child Manak became an ascetic at the age of eight years. Through his 
knowledge of astrology, it was revealed on Shayyambhav that the child had a very 
short life span. This inspired him to create the Dashavaikalika Sutra based on his 
knowledge of the canons. This work became very popular in the later Jain tradition. 
After remaining head of the order for twenty three years, Shayyambhav expired in 
the year 98 A.N.M. (371 B.V., 428 B.C.) when he was sixty two years old. During his 
times the state of Magadh was ruled by the Nand family. 
[024] MEANING -I pay homage to Arya Yashobhadra of the Tungik gotra, 
Arya Sambhooti Vijay of the Madhar gotra, Acharya Bhadrabahu of the Prachin gotra 
and Acharya Sthoolibhadra of the Gautam gotra. 
COMMENTARY- (Shrut-Kevali or Chaturdash Purvadhar Lineage) 
In the lineage of the heads of the order after Bhagavan Mahavir there were 
two omniscients - Arya Sudharma and Arya Jambu. With passage of time and 
increasing distance from the Tirthankar there was a constant depletion of knowledge 
and the possibilities of attaining omniscience ended. The post Jambu Swami 
Pattadhars did not become omniscients but they absorbed the complete knowledge 
contained in the words of the Tirthankar; in other words the twelve Angas including 
the fourteen Purvas. That is why they were popularly known as Shrut-kewalis or 
Chaturdash-purvadhars. This tradition continued upto Acharya Bhadrabahu. 
Arya Yashobhadra - He was born in a Brahman family belonging to Tungik 
gotra in the year 36 A.N.M. (433 B.V., 390 B.C.). He was among the top scholars of 
his time in the ritualistic Vedic tradition. Deeply influenced by the discourses of Arya 
Shayyambhav, he took Diksha when he was twenty two years old. Under the 
direction of his guru he absorbed all the knowledge of the canons for fourteen years. 
He succeeded Arya Shayyambhav as Head of the Order at the age of thirty six 
years. 
After successfully managing the organization for fifty years he died in the year 
148 A.N.M. (321 B.V., 378 B.C.). During his times the eighth Nand ruled over the 
state of Magadh. It is believed that he influenced the Nand rulers with his discourses. 
He brought about a revolutionary change in the Jain religious organization - for the 
first time Yashobhadra promoted two of his disciples to the position of Acharya. 
Arya Sambhooti Vijay -The senior disciple of Arya Yashobhadra, Arya 
Sambhooti Vijay belonged to a Brahman family of Madhar gotra. He became a 
Chaturdash Purvadhar (the knower of the fourteen Purvas or sublime canons) after 
learning all the scriptural knowledge from Arya Yashobhadra. The members of the 
family of famous historical figure Shaktal, the prime minister of Magadh state, were 
his followers. He died in the year 156 A.N.M. (313 B.V., 370 B.C.) 
Arya Bhadrabahu - The second disciple of Acharya Yashobhadra was Arya 
Bhadrabahu. He was born in a Brahman family of Prachin gotra in Pratishthanpur 
(Paithan) in the year 94 A.N.M. (375 B.V., 432 B.C.). Following his family tradition he 
studied numerous subjects but due to his profound liking for the tenets of Vitaraga 
(the Detached or the Tirthankar) he became an ascetic disciple of Acharya 
Yashobhadra in the year 139 A.N.M. He studied under his guru for seventeen long 
years to acquire all scriptural knowledge. 
After the death of Arya Sambhooti Vijaya in the year 156 A.N.M. Arya Bhadra- 
bahu became the Head of the Order. During Bhadrabahu's time there was a 
devastating twelve-year-drought. Collecting alms became difficult for shramans

whose only means of living was alms. The ascetic order disintegrated and strayed 
towards the sea shore. The system of studying and memorizing the scriptures was 
disrupted. This long period of hardships caused the diffusion of scriptural knowledge. 
When the conditions improved the ascetic order assembled at Patliputra and 
made the Herculean effort of compiling all that remained in the memory of the then 
extant ascetics. The twelfth Anga titled Drishtivad could not be compiled. Besides 
Bhadrabahu there was no ascetic scholar left, who had complete knowledge of the 
canons. Bhadrabahu was spending his time in seclusion in Nepal, busy with his 
higher spiritual practices. On the request of the Sangh he agreed to impart all his 
knowledge to some able students. 
The Sangh selected five hundred brilliant ascetics for this task and sent them 
to Nepal. Only Sthulibhadra could complete this tough course, all the others returned 
much earlier. Even Sthulibhadra could not reach the prescribed level of discipline 
and as such he could absorb only ten (two chapters less) of the fourteen Purvas, 
complete with their text and meaning. Of the remaining four he could only memorize 
the text. 
Besides imparting the education of the twelve canons, Bhadrabahu also wrote 
the Chheda Sutras – Dashashrutaskandha, the Brihatkalpa and Vyavahar Sutra. He 
died in the year 170 A.N.M. (299 B.V., 356 B.C.). With him the Shrutkevali lineage 
(those who knew both the text and the meaning of all the fourteen Purvas) became 
extinct. 
Arya Sthoolibhadra - He was born in a famous Brahman family of Gautam 
gotra living in Magadh. He was the son of the illustrious minister Shakatal who was 
the back bone of Magadh politics. He had seven sisters, who later became ascetics 
under Acharya Sambhooti Vijay. His younger brother Shriyak was in the state 
services. 
When he was young, Sthulabhadra's father sent him to the divinely beautiful 
courtesan Kosha to learn various facets of social behavior. Infatuated with the 
beauty of Kosha, Sthulabhadra stayed with her. It was only after twelve years that he 
came out of her house, when the king invited him to accept the post of prime 
minister, vacated due to the death of Shakatal. The news of the death of his father 
caused by some political conspiracy brought about a marked change in 
Sthulabhadra's attitude. 
He resolved to renounce the social life to become an ascetic. In the year 146 
A.N.M. (323 B.V., 380 B.C.) he took diksha from Arya Sambhooti Vijay. The story of 
his spending a monsoon-stay at Kosha's residence in order to test his determination 
and discipline is a popular saga in Jain history. 
Sthulabhadra was the organizer of the conference of ascetics called for the 
compilation of the canonical knowledge scattered due to the twelve year drought. 
After compiling the eleven Angas, five hundred ascetics were sent to Bhadrabahu for 
learning the twelfth, Drishtivad. Only Sthulabhadra had the capability and 
determination to learn Drishtivad. When he had acquired the complete knowledge-of 
the text and the meaning of its ten chapters an incident occurred that put an abrupt 
stop to his learning. 
His seven sisters, who had become ascetic, became curious about his 
endeavor and planned a visit to see it for them. With the help of his knowledge, 
Sthulabhadra came to know about their planned visit. In order to display his powers 
and to give his sisters a surprise Sthulabhadra transformed himself into a lion and

Aagam- 44 -NandiSootra

waited for them. When his sisters came and stood rooted at the spot with fear he 
regained his natural form. The sisters were astonished and filled with pride at this 
display of divine power by their brother. 
Arya Bhadrabahu came to know of all these happenings. The display of 
miracles without some dire need is considered laxness in the ascetic conduct. The 
guru got annoyed with Sthulabhadra and stopped any further teaching of the Agams. 
After Sthulabhadra sincerely sought his forgiveness and beseeched him to continue 
the lessons Sthulabhadra was given just the text of the remaining four Purvas and 
not the meaning. The Chaturdash Purvadhar lineage ended here. Sthulabhadra was 
the first Dash Purvadhar (knower of the ten Purvas). He was completely devoted to 
the tasks of organizing the religious order and compiling the canonical knowledge. 
Sthulabhadra died in the year 215 A.N.M. (254 B.V., 311 B.C.). 
[025]MEANING -I pay homage to Mahagiri of the Elapatya gotra and Suhasti, 
and then to Ballissaha of the Kaushik gotra who was equal in age to Bahul. 
COMMENTARY -The lineage of Dash Purvadhar starting with Acharya 
Sthulabhadra continued for about two hundred fifty years. It comprised of a galaxy of 
exemplary and great scholars each of whom became famous as Yuga-pradhan 
(leader of the era) because of his towering personality and telling influence. 
Arya Mahagiri - The estimated period of the birth of Arya Mahagiri of 
Elapatya gotra is 145 A.N.M. (324 B.V., 381 B.C.). No information is available about 
his parents. The only mention about his early age is that he spent his childhood with 
Arya Yaksha. At the age of thirty years he was initiated by Acharya Sthulabhadra in 
the year 175 A.N.M. (284 WV. 341 B.C.). For about forty years he studied under his 
guru and acquired all the available scriptural knowledge to become a Dash 
Purvadhar. 
After the death of Arya Sthulabhadra he became the Head of the Order in the 
year 215 A.N.M. It is believed that Acharya Sthulabhadra promoted both him and 
Arya Suhasti to the position of Acharya but the Head of the Order was Arya 
Mahagiri. After imparting the scriptural knowledge to his colleague Arya Suhasti, and 
the disciples, Arya Mahagiri commenced his special spiritual practices. However, he 
moved along with the group. He was a strict follower and supporter of purity of 
conduct and never hesitated in advising Arya Suhasti if he saw any laxness. He died 
in the year 245 A.N.M. (224 B.V., 281 B.C.). According to historical chronology he 
was contemporary of both Emperor Chandragupta Maurya and his son Bindusar. 
Arya Suhasti - The estimated period of the birth of Arya Suhasti of Vashishta 
gotra is 191 A.N.M. (278 B.V., 335 B.C.). As in the case of Arya Mahagiri, no 
information is available about his parents. The only mention about his early age is 
that he spent his childhood with Arya Yaksha. There is a difference of opinion about 
the period of his initiation. However, the probable date should be somewhere 
between 214-215 A.N.M. (312-311 B.C.). Thus it appears that he must have 
acquired the scriptural knowledge from Arya Sthulabhadra as well as Arya Mahagiri. 
As he was made an Acharya along with Arya Suhasti, who commenced his 
higher practices, he must have taken over the responsibility of managing the Sangh. 
His independent management of the Sangh started in the year 245 A.N.M. (224 B.V., 
281 B.C.) when Arya Mahagiri died. It was during his reign over the religious 
organization that Bindusar died and Ashoka became the emperor. After the long 
reign of Ashoka, his grandson Samprati became the emperor.

Arya Suhasti gave discourse to Samprati and made him a devotee. Emperor 
Samprati had great faith in Jain religion. His reign is known as the golden period in 
Jain history. Emperor Samprati enthusiastically worked for the spread of Jainism 
throughout the area under his rule. 
COMMENTARY -Arya Mangu - After the death of Acharya Samudra in 454 
A.N.M. Arya Mangu became the Vachanacharya. He was among one of the teachers 
of the Digambar Acharya Yati Vrishabh, the author of Kashaya Pahud. No further 
information about him is available. It is said that he was a contemporary of King 
Vikramaditya of Avanti. 
[029] MEANING -I pay homage to Arya Dharma and to Arya Bhadragupt and 
then to Arya Vajra who had become diamond-hard (vajra) through virtues like 
austerity and discipline. 
After remaining Acharya for 46 years and leaving behind a well knit family of 
large number of disciples he died in the year 291 A.N.M. (178 B.V., 235 B.C.). 
For the purpose of proper management of the religious order Arya Suhasti 
made three divisions of the duties and rights resting in the position of Acharya - 
Ganadhar lineage, Vachak lineage and Yuga-pradhan lineage. It was an important 
mile stone in the history of the Jain religious organization. This was the first attempt 
to evolve a management system aimed at envisaging and countering the possible 
pressures of changing times that are responsible for disintegration of the religious 
organization. 
Arya Ballissaha - Not much information is available about Arya Ballissah of 
the Kaushik gotra. He was a disciple of Arya Mahagiri and, like him, gave a special 
stress on practice of pure conduct. After the death of Arya Mahagiri he became the 
Ganacharya (group chief) of his group. 
Recognizing him as the most able scholar of scriptural knowledge, Arya 
Suhasti made him the Vachanacharya (the head of the scriptural scholars). He made 
important contribution towards spread of the scriptural knowledge and played a 
leading role in compiling and editing of the scriptures. The estimated date of his 
demise is 329 A.N.M. The twenty four year period when Acharya Ballissah was the 
Vachanacharya was a period of turmoil in Indian history. Acharya Ballissah saw the 
golden periods of the Maurayan emperors Chandragupta, Bindusar and Samprati, 
there gradual fall followed by the cruel rule of Pushaymitra Shung. He was a witness 
to the two best periods in Jain history - the reigns of emperor Samprati and Maha 
Meghvahan Kharvel of Kalinga. 
[026] MEANING -I pay homage to Swati of Hareet gotra, Arya Shyama also of 
the Hareet gotra, and then to Arya Jeetdhar Shandilya of the Kaushik gotra. 
COMMENTARY -Of the post Suhasti period, various lists of lineage 
(pattavalis), based on the divisions of duties, are available. These include names of 
many important Acharyas. Here mainly those Acharyas who belonged to the 
Vachak-vansh (those who taught the Agams) have been mentioned. 
Arya Swati - After Acharya Ballissaha his disciple Arya Swati became the 
Vachanacharya. He belonged to Hareet gotra. Hardly any information about him is 
available. The estimated period of his death is between 335-336 A.N.M. (134-133 
B.V., 192 B.C.). 
Arya Shyama - He was born in a family belonging to Hareet gotra in the year 
280 A.N.M. He was initiated into the order by Arya Swati when he was 20 years old. 
After a thirty five year long period of studies he became the Vachanacharya as well

as the Yuga-pradhan. Shyama Arya was the leading scholar of Dravyanuyoga (Jain 
metaphysics) of his time. He is believed to be Kalakacharya the First, the elaborator 
of Nigod (the lowest or the dormant form of life). Hearing the praise of his knowledge 
from Simandhar Swami, Saudharmendra asked questions regarding Nigod from 
Shyamarya and was satisfied. 
He was the author of Pannavana Sutra which is believed to be a unique 
compendium of knowledge of the fundamentals. The period of Shyamacharya is the 
historical period of antipathy for Jain religion. During this period of re-establishing of 
the ritual Yajna tradition and the torture of Jains and Buddhists by Pushyamitra 
Shung, Shyamacharya accomplished the impossible feat of imparting stability to the 
Shraman tradition. He died in the year 376 A.N.M. (93 B.V., 150 B.C.). 
Arya Shandilya (Skandilacharya) - After the death of Shyamacharya in 376 
A.N.M. Arya Shandilya became the Vachanacharya and Yuga-pradhanacharya. He 
was born in the year 306 A.N.M. and initiated in the year 328 A.N.M. (141 B.V., 198 
B.C.). It is believed that he was honored with the title of Jeetdhar Arya because he 
wrote a scripture titled Jeet Maryada and was very particular about following the Jeet 
conduct. He was the founder of the Shandilya Gaccha which was later amalgamated 
with Chandra Gaccha. No more information about him is available. He died in the 
year 414 A.N.M. (54 B.V., 111 B.C.). 
[027] MEANING -I pay homage to Arya Samudra whose fame had spread 
right up to the three seas and whose credibility was established even beyond many 
islands and seas (or who was a distinguished scholar of Dveep Sagar Prajnapti). 
COMMENTARY–Arya Samudra - After Arya Shandilya Arya Samudra 
became the Vachanacharya in the year 414 A.N.M. He was a great and respected 
scholar and his field of special expertise was geography. No more information about 
him is available. The mention that his fame spread right up to the three seas 
indicates that he must have extensively toured all around India. According to the 
Kalakacharya Katha, Sagar Suri also toured in Suwarna Bhoomi Dveep (today 
known as - Java, Sumatra, Indonesia), He died in the year 454 A.N.M. (15 B.V., 72 
B.C.). Vriddha Vadi, the guru of Acharya Siddhasen Divakar, was his disciple. 
[028] MEANING - I pay homage to Arya Mangu, the embodiment of serenity 
who studied the Kalik Sutras (the scriptures that are studied or recited only at a 
prescribed time of the day) and followed the conduct defined in the scriptures, who 
indulged in spiritual and meditational practices and enhanced virtues of knowledge, 
perception and conduct, who had also swam across the sea of scriptures. 
COMMENTARY -Arya Mangu - After the death of Arya Samudra in 454 
A.N.M. Arya Mangu became the Vachanacharya. He was among one of the teachers 
of the Digambar Acharya Yati Vrishabh, the author of Kashaya Pahud. No further 
information about him is available. It is said that he was a contemporary of King 
Vikramaditya of Avanti. 
[029] MEANING -I pay homage to Arya Dharma and to Arya Bhadragupt and 
then to Arya Vajra who had become diamond-hard - (vajra-वज्र) - through virtues like 
austerity and discipline. 
COMMENTARY -Arya Mangu - After the death of Acharya Samudra in 454

[029] MEANING -I pay homage to Arya Dharma and to Arya Bhadragupt and

austerity and discipline. 
COMMENTARY-In the opinion of commentators Jindas gani Mahattar 
(Churnikar), Acharya Haribhadra Suri (Vrittikar) and Malayagiri (Tikakar) these 
verses and are interpolated. However, they are available in the ancient manuscripts 
and according to Acharya Shri Hastimalji M., the Acharyas mentioned therein were 
great scholars of Agams and towering personalities of their respective times. For 
their special talents these Yuga-pradhanacharyas must have been accepted as 
Vachanacharyas in spite of their not belonging to the Vachak-lineage. 
Arya Dharma - Arya Shandilya was succeeded by Arya Revatimitra and then 
by Arya Dharma as Yuga-pradhanacharya. He was born in the year 392 A.N.M. (77 
B.V., 134 B.C.). After getting initiated at the age of 12 years and a 40 year long 
period of ascetic practices he became Yuga-pradhanacharya in the year 450 A.N.M. 
(19 B.V., 76 B.C.). He died in the year 494 A.N.M. (25 V., 32 B.C.). (V. = year of the 
Vikram calendar) 
Arya Bhadragupt - Arya Dharma was succeeded by Arya Bhadragupta as 
Yuga-pradhanacharya. He was born in the year 422 A.N.M. (47 B.V., 104 B.C.) and 
was initiated in the year 449 A.N.M. (17 B.V., 74 B.C.). At the age of 45 years he 
became Yuga-pradhanacharya in the year 494 A.N.M. and he died in the year 533 
A.N.M. (64 V., 7 A.D.). He was a great scholar of astrology and the teacher of the 
renowned Acharya Vajra Swami. 
Arya VajraSwami - It is believed that the extremely intelligent last Dasha-
purvadhar, Arya Vajra Swami had acquired Jati-smaran jnana (the knowledge about 
earlier births). This unique person is probably the only example in Jain history that 
was given as alms at the age of 6 months to his own father who was an ascetic. He 
was brought up in the midst of Shramanis (female ascetics), as a result of which he 
had acquired the voluminous knowledge of scriptures at an early age. The grand-son 
of merchant Dhan of Avanti and the son of Dhanagiri, Arya Vajra had started giving 
scriptural discourses to his colleague shramans (Jain ascetics) when he was still a 
minor. For acquiring the knowledge of Purvas his guru Arya Simhagiri sent him to 
Arya Bhadragupta. 
After absorbing the knowledge of ten Purvas he returned to Arya Simhagiri. 
He was awarded the status of Acharya in the year 548 A.N.M. (79 V., 22 A.D.). For 
the spread of religion Acharya Vajra toured extensively and inspired the masses with 
his profound knowledge and strict austerities. Acharya Vajra Swami died somewhere 
in southern India in the year 584 A.N.M. (115 V., 58 A.D.). The famous Chinese 
traveler Huentsang had met him during his travels to India and was highly impressed 
with his knowledge of astrology. He has mentioned this in his travelogue. 
[030] MEANING -I pay homage to the great austere ascetic Arya Rakshit, 
who protected the all-important possession of right conduct belonging to him and the 
other practices; who also protected the jewellery-chest like Anuyog (the subject wise 
classified divisions of vast scriptural knowledge). 
COMMENTARY -According to the popular belief in the Shvetämbar tradition, 
the second phase in the decline of the scriptural knowledge started after the death of 
Arya Vajra; the knowledge of the ten Purvas was extant up to Arya Vajra. After him it 
gradually diminished. The changing times brought about a continuing decline in the 
general intelligence and capacity to remember. The shramans of that period put 
 
NandiSootra 
 
Aagam- 44 -NandiSootra 
~ 17 ~ 
Compiled by- Deepratnasagar 
 
themselves to the task of finding all possible ways and means of saving the scriptural 
knowledge. 
Arya Rakshit - He was born in the house of Brahman Somdev, an inhabitant 
of Dashpur (modern Mandsor) in the state of Malwa in the year 522 A.N.M. (53 V., 4 
B.C.). His mother was Jain; that is why when he completed his conventional Vedic 
education, she inspired him to acquire the knowledge of Jain scriptures. 
The Brahman youth Rakshit went to Acharya Toshaliputra and begged him for 
scriptural knowledge. When Toshaliputra told him that unless he gets initiated in to 
the order he could not be given scriptural knowledge, strong willed Rakshit at once 
got initiated and left the town with the Acharya. By acquiring the knowledge of all the 
eleven Angas in short time Arya Rakshit thoroughly impressed Toshaliputra, who 
then sent him to Vajra Swami to acquire the knowledge of ten Purvas. 
Even Arya Rakshit, a highly talented individual of that age, could only absorb 
the complete knowledge contained in nine Purvas and just a part of the tenth. After 
this he returned to Toshaliputra. In the year 544 A.N.M. Toshaliputra made him 
Acharya and honored him with the status of Yuga-pradhan. 
Arya Rakshit became aware of the ongoing process of decline of intellect and 
capability with the passage of time. He accomplished the task of classifying the 
scriptural knowledge into four divisions in order to simplify the method of study and 
revolutionized the process of scriptural learning. Before this classification Agams 
were taught one at a time and the aphorisms, fundamentals, codes of conduct, 
examples, areas of practices, rules etc. pertaining to that Agam were taught at the 
same time. 
Arya Rakshit classified the complete contents of all Agams into four Anuyogs. 
These classifications are Charan-karananuyog (conduct or activity), Dharma- 
kathanuyog 
(narrative 
subjects 
like 
stories, 
examples, 
biographies 
etc.), 
Ganitanuyog (mathematics) and Dravyanuyog (fundamentals and substances or 
metaphysics). 
This classification immensely helped the later scholars and commentators. 
The process of learning scriptures became easier and a new path was shown for 
preserving the hitherto vanishing scriptural knowledge as much as possible. The Jain 
tradition will always be indebted to Arya Rakshit for this. Arya Rakshit left for his 
heavenly abode in the year 597 A.N.M. (128 V., 71 A.D.). 
[031] MEANING -I bow my head and pay homage to ascetic Arya Nandil, who 
was ever indulgent in practices like pursuit of knowledge, purity of perception, 
observation of austerities and behavior of humbleness. And being free of attachment 
and aversion, who was always in a blissful state of mind. 
COMMENTARY -Arya Nandil - He was an earlier Acharya. He is not listed as 
Yuga-pradhanacharya. In the lineage of Vachanacharyas Arya Nandil succeeds Arya 
Mangu (5th century A.N.M.). No historical information about him is available. 
[032] MEANING -May the Vachak -lineage of Arya Nagahasti - who was 
proficient in explicating such subjects as Vyakaran (grammar in general and 
Prashnavyakaran Sutra in particular), Karan (codes of conduct and related scriptures 
like Pinda vishuddhi), 
Bluing (seven segments of logic split according to varied viewpoints, the 
segmentation of codes to help memorizing and observation, and the related 
scriptures), Karma Prakriti (the nature of karma-particles) - beget glory.

COMMENTARY- 0-Arya Nagahasti - In the Vachak-lineage Arya Nagahasti 
succeeded Arya Nandil as Vachanacharya. Not much information is available about 
him. The renowned Acharya Paadhpt was his disciple. His long tenure as 
Vachanacharya saw three Yuga-pradhanacharyas - Arya Shrigupt, Arya Vajra and 
Arya Rakshit. Therefore his probable period of activity must be somewhere between 
423 and 584 A.N.M. 
[033] MEANING -May the Vachak-lineage of Arya Revati Nakshatra - who 
hada glow as soothing to the eyes as is Anjan-metal (a metallic Ayurvedic 
preparation used as ophthalmic medicine and tonic), and who had a radiance like 
blue grapes and blue lotus - be ever expanding. 
COMMENTARY -Arya Revati Nakshatra - Arya Revati Nakshatra succeeded 
Arya Nagahasti as Vachanacharya. Besides themention of his name, no other 
information is available. That is why he is being confused with Yuga-pradhanacharya 
Arya Revati Mitra. But an in-depth study of the periods of the Acharyas of both the, 
lineages reveals that they were two different persons. Arya Revati Nakshatra must 
have lived some time between 550 to 650 A.N.M. (81 to 181 V., 24 to 124 A.D.). 
During his tenure the Vachak group progressed considerably. 
[034] MEANING -I pay homage to Simhacharya of the Brahmadvipik 
branchwho got initiated in Achalpur, who was a great exponent ofKalik Sutras, and 
who attained the lofty status of Vachak (Vachanacharya). 
COMMENTARY -Arya Simha - Arya Brahmadvipik Simha succeeded Arya 
Revati Nakshatra as Vachanacharya. About him also there is no definite opinion if he 
was same as Yuga-pradhanacharya Simha or a different person. He has been 
accepted as a proficient elaborator of the Kalik Sutras. According to the available 
information about Yuga-pradhanacharya Simha, the important dates of his life are - 
Birth-710 A.N.M. (241 V., 184 A.D.). Diksha-722 A.N.M. (253 V., 196 A.D.). Death - 
826 A.N.M. (357 V., 300 A.D.). 
[035] MEANING -I pay homage to Skandilacharya whose Anuyogs are still 
popular in the Ardhabharat Kshetra (India) and whose glory has swarmed many 
cities. 
COMMENTARY -Arya Skandil - He was born in Mathura. His parents were 
Brahman Megharath and Roopsena. His name was Somarath and his family was 
originally Jain. Once during a Mathura stay of Arya Simha, Somarath got impressed 
with his discourse and got initiated. He studied the extant scriptural knowledge under 
his guru. 
There is unanimity about his period of activity being between 823 and 840 
A.N.M. This was a period of turmoil in Indian History. In the central part of India 
battles raged between the Huns and the Guptas and in absence of some influential 
central power the smaller kingdoms were continuing to feud with one another. 
During this period also there was a 12-twelve year drought. In such trouble 
edtimes the scriptural knowledge once again started to deplete. Some time between 
830 and 840 A.N.M. (361 and 371 V, 304 and 314 A.D.) 
He invited all the shramans from northern India at Mathura. This congregation 
of scholarly ascetics accomplished the task of reciting and compiling the scriptures 
and reorganizing the Anuyogs. 
In the Jain history this event is famous as Mathuri Vachana. The available 
form of Jain scriptures is credited to this Mathura congregation. In this context there 
 
NandiSootra

is a mention that a shravak belonging to the Os clan arranged for getting the texts 
written on palm leaves and presenting them to the ascetics. 
The Jains as well as the world literature will ever be indebted to Arya Skandil 
for his immense service of saving the scriptural knowledge from impending 
extinction. 
[036]MEANING -After this, I bow my head and pay homage to Acharya 
Himavan who was as towering as the Himalayas, who had infinite patience and 
resolve, and who studied endlessly. 
COMMENTARY–Arya Himavan - It is believed that Arya Himavan was a 
disciple of Skandilacharya. No information is available about the dates of his birth, 
initiation etc. According to the lineage charts his period is estimated to be the middle 
of the 9thcentury A.N.M.  
[037] MEANING -After that I pay homage to Shri Nagarjunacharya who had 
absorbed the Anuyogs -relating to the Kalik Sutras and the knowledge of the Purvas 
like Utpad. 
[038] MEANING -I pay homage to Nagarjun Vachak who embodied the 
attitudes of sweetness and sympathy, who adhered to the proper observance of the 
Ogh-shrut or the laid down procedure of systematic detachment, and gradually 
ascended to the status of Vachak (Vachanacharya). 
COMMENTARY -Arya Nagarjun - It is believed that Arya Nagarjun was the 
son of Kshatriya (the second caste in the traditional Hindu caste-hierarchy; the 
warrior or the regal caste) Sangram Simha of Dhank city. Since his childhood he was 
very braveand intelligent. He was impressed by the miracles of Paadlipt Suri. 
It is said that he was a disciple of both Paadlipt Sun and Acharya Himvant but 
there is no clear indication as to which of these was his initiator and which the 
teacher. However, as his period does not coincide with that of Paadlipt Suri, his 
being a disciple of Paadlipt Suri appears just to be hear say. 
The statement that he reached the status of Vachanacharya gradually 
becomes clear when we study the lineage of Acharyas of that period. According to 
the available information Arya Skandil, Arya Himavan and Arya Nagarjun were 
contemporaries and all the three were Vachanacharyas. 
According to this verse he succeeded Arya Himvant and according to the 
Yuga-pradhan lineage chart he succeeded Arya Simha as Yuga-pradhanacharya. 
As per the available dates it appears that after the death of Arya Simha in the 
year 826 A.N.M., the specially talented Arya Skandil must have been made 
Vachanacharya and at the same time young Nagarjun must have been made Yuga-
pradhanacharya After that, in the year 840 A.N.M. when Arya Skandil died, the 
senior ascetic Himavan must have been made Vachanacharya. 
When Arya Himavan died, in absence of another capable shraman, Nagarjun 
must 
have been given 
the 
joint 
responsibilities 
& 
positions 
of 
Yuga-
pradhanacharyaand Vachanacharya. 
Almost coinciding with the Mathura congregation organized by Arya Skandil, 
Arya Nagarjun also organized another convention of shramans in Vallabhi in 
southern India. The two Acharyas could not meet after these congregations and so 
the task of removing differences in the compiled texts was left undone. The important 
dates in the life of Arya Nagarjun are - Birth-793 A.N.M. (324 V., 267 A.D.), Diksha-
807 A.N.M. (338 V., 281 A.D.)., Death-904 A.N.M. (435 V., 378 A.D.)., Emperor 
Chandragupta of Magadh and his son Samudragupta were his contemporaries.

[039 to 41] MEANING -His complexion is golden like pure smelted gold or a 
Champa flower, or the pollen of the best quality lotus flower; he rules over the hearts 
of Bhavya beings (those who are capable of attaining moksha) and expertly invokes 
the virtue of altruism in masses; he was accepted as the Yug-pradhan (leader of the 
era) throughout India; he was the ultimate expert of all the processes of self-study 
and the promoter of many accomplished ascetics into practices like self-study; he 
was the enhancer of the glory of the Nagendra group (of ascetics); and he had the 
capability to guide all beings towards betterment and remove the fear of ties of 
rebirth. I pay homage to such Acharya Bhootadinn, the disciple of Rishi Nagarjun. 
COMMENTARY-Arya Bhootadinn - He succeeded Arya Nagarjun as 
Vachanacharya. In the PRAISE - Dushsham-kaal Shri Shraman Sangh Stotra' he 
has been mentioned as Yuga-pradhanacharya. Hardly any more information about 
him is available. If he is accepted as Yuga-pradhanacharya according to the Yuga-
pradhan chart, important dates in his life should be - Birth-864 A.N.M. (395 V., 338 
A.D.), Diksha-882 A.N.M. (413 V., 356 A.D.), Yuga-pradhan status-904 A.N.M. (435 
V., 372 A.D.), Death-923 A.N.M. (454 V., 397 A.D.). In Indian history this was the 
period of successive reigns of Samudragupta, Chandragupta II, and Kumaragupta. 
[042] MEANING -I pay homage to the Arya whose name was Lohitya and 
who properly understood the substances like sentient and non-sentient, who 
absorbed the scriptures after fully understandingthe text and the meaning, and who 
was the true explicator of the spirit of the tenets expounded by the omniscient. 
COMMENTARY -Arya Lohitya - Except for this mention, now here any 
information is available about Arya Lohitya who succeeded Arya Bhootadinn. 
[043] MEANING -With all reverence I pay homage to Dooshyagani who was 
like a treasure trove of meanings and interpretations of the scriptures, who imparted 
satisfaction by clarifying doubts and queries posed by able ascetics while giving 
them discourse of Agams and who had naturally sweet and soothing voice. 
[044] MEANING -He was embellished with the said virtues and had the finer 
qualities of the orator Acharyas. I bow at his delicate and beautiful feet that were 
worshipped by hundreds of disciples. 
COMMENTARY -Arya Dushyagani - Like Arya Lohitya no information 
anywhere is available about his successor Arya Dushyagani except for this mention. 
This praise gives an indication that the author of this work, Dev Vachak or 
Devardhigani Kshamashraman was a disciple of this Dushyagani. 
There is a lack of detailed information about Devardhigani also, but he was 
present at the Vallabhi convention. This indicates that he was alive in the year 980 
A.N.M. (511 V., 568 A.D.). Thus the period of activity of Dushyagani must have been 
the middle part of the 10th century A.N.M. 
[045]MEANING- After paying my homage to all the other Acharyas, who – We 
reexperts of Kalik Sutras and Anuyog I commence presenting the knowledge 
propagated by Tirthankars. 
COMMENTARY–Devardhigani Kshamashraman after Dushyagani his 
disciple Deva Vachak or (-Perhaps- Devardhigani Kshamashraman?) became the 
Vachanacharya. This lofty personality will always occupy a reverential place in the 
Jain tradition. There volutionary work he accomplished in the year 980 A.N.M. is 
available to us as the treasury of Jain scriptures. Devardhigani not only compiled and 
edited the depleting wealth of Jain scriptures but also gave permanence to the 
tradition of scriptural knowledge bygetting it transcribed.

By birth he was a Kshatriya of the Kashyap gotra. He was born at a place 
named Vairaval in Saurashtra. There is a belief that he was initiated by Arya Lohitya. 
But examining the available evidences and comparing them with historical dates, his 
being a disciple of Arya Dushyagani seems to be more logical. He was probably 
taught the Agams and one Purva by Acharya Lohitya. 
No information is available about important events of his life. However it is an 
established traditional belief that with his death in 1000 A.N.M. the knowledge of the 
Purvas, the sublime canons, became extinct. 
✻TYPES OF LISTENERS✻ 
FOURTEEN TYPES OF LISTENERS 
Introduction - It is a convention that as the first step of commencing the 
writing of a book a prayer wishing well being andremoval of hurdles is written in the 
form of a PRAISE of the Arhator teachers. After this, generally an introduction of the 
subject matter discussed in the book is given. But a new experimental style can be 
seen in this book. Before dealing with the introduction of the subject matter first the 
virtues and rights of the recipients of theknowledge or the listeners have been 
discussed and then their congregation. 
This has been presented in a gripping style with beautiful and befitting 
examples. 
[046] MEANING -According to the variations in quality, different types of 
listeners are like-1. Smooth rock (shail) that remains uneffected by down pour from 
rain clouds (ghan), 2. Earthen pitcher, 3.Sieve, 4.Filter, 5.Swan, 6.Buffalo, 7.Ram 
8.Mosquito, 9.Leech, 10.Cat, 11.Rat, 12.Cow, 13.Trumpet, and 14. Ahir. 
COMMENTARY -The widely accepted norm about knowledge is that it should 
be imparted to a worthy person, not unworthy. Same is true for scriptural knowledge. 
A person who is wicked, foolish, dull, adamant, impolite, carnal, or having other such 
vices always abuses knowledge. Therefore he is unworthy. One who has interest, 
curiosity, sincerity, humbleness, and right conduct is worthy of scriptural knowledge. 
The author has explained the vices and virtues of a listener with fourteen examples– 
1. Smooth rock - There is a rock known as Mudg-rock which is as smooth as 
black-gram. Even if it incessantly rains over it for one week, water does not seep into 
it. Even if it is kept submerged in water for years, it does not become damp. A 
person having attributes like this stone is not even slightly inspired towards the right 
path in spite of being preached continuously for years. He is as dogmatic and 
adamant as Goshalak and Jamali who could not be corrected even by Bhagavan 
Mahavir himself. Such listeners, who are as obstinate as Ravan and Duryodhan, are 
unworthy and should be rejected. 
2. Earthen pitcher - These are of two types - unbaked and baked. A pitcher 
that is dried in sun is unbaked. It cannot be used to fill water in it because as soon as 
water is poured in, it disintegrates and water flows out. An infant with such a nature, 
or a listener with an undeveloped and immature mind, like an infant, is absolutely 
unworthy. 
A baked pitcher is also of two types - new and old. A new pitcher is most 
suitable for filling water. Water filled in such a pitcher is generally not spoiled and it 
remains cool and satisfying. A listener with such disposition, who has a mature mind 
but has not become preconditioned or prejudiced by absorbing other knowledge or 
information, is most worthy recipient of scriptural knowledge. 
 
NandiSootra 
 
Aagam- 44 -NandiSootra

Compiled by- Deepratnasagar 
 
An old pitcher is of two types. One that is old but has not been used for 
storing water. Such pitcher does not lose all its properties. When used, it still keeps 
the water clean and cool. A listener having similar nature, who although old yet free 
of prejudices and misconceptions, is a worthy recipient of scriptural knowledge,. 
An old and used pitcher is also of two types. One that has been used for 
storing pure and fragrant water. Listeners having similar nature, who have, through 
learning, absorbed virtues and not vices are the worthy ones. 
The second type of used pitcher is that in which wines and other foul smelling 
liquids have been stored. If the stink of such pitcher is automatically removed after 
some time, it can be used. However, if it stinks permanently it cannot be used. In the 
same way a listener, who has acquired vices but can be free of them with 
perseverance, is a worthy recipient of knowledge. A listener who is so wrapped up in 
vices that their neither is an effort nor a chance of being free from vices is absolutely 
inappropriate and unworthy recipient of knowledge. 
3. Sieve - No matter how much liquid is poured into a sieve it is never full. The 
bigger the holes the sooner it becomes empty. As long as it remains submerged in 
water it appears filled but the moment it is brought out, it is empty. The purpose of a 
sieve is to allow the useful part to pass through and retain what is useless and is to 
be thrown. A listener with similar nature forgets whatever he listens. Also, while 
listening he is attentive of vices and not virtues. He is unworthy. 
4. Filter - The property of a filter is to retain the dirt and allow the clean liquid 
to pass through. A person with such nature while listening retains vices and allows 
the virtues to pass through. He is an unworthy recipient of scriptural knowledge. In 
the Bhashya (a style of commentary) Paripurnak is interpreted as the nest of Baya 
(weaver bird) which when used as a filter retains dirt and allows pure Ghee to pass 
through. 
5. Swan - It is believed to be the best among birds in terms of beauty and 
disposition. It is used as a metaphor for discriminating between good and bad. In 
Hindi there is a proverb based on this supposed attitude of swan –  
a swan either eats pearls or remains hungry. A listener with a swan-like 
selective attitude absorbs virtue sand rejects vices while listening. Such a listener is 
a worthy recipient of scriptural knowledge. 
6. Buffalo - By nature a buffalo is adverse to cleanliness. It generally sits in 
slime. Even if it enters clean water it makes the water slimy. A listener having such 
attitude avoids places where knowledge is given. If at all he goes there, he spoils the 
atmosphere, creates disturbance for others, and utters incoherently and acts 
irrationally. Such a listener is an unworthy recipient of scriptural knowledge. 
7. Ram - A ram, as other animals of that species, drinks water by going on its 
front knees and sipping water from the surface of a water-body. This way it ensures 
that it gets clean water to drink and at the same time the water body is also not 
soiled. A listener having such attitude listens to the guru with apt attention and 
absorbs the essence. Such a listener is a worthy recipient of scriptural knowledge. 
8. Mosquito - A mosquito and other such insects sting and suck blood from 
the body they sit on. A listener having such attitude inflicts pain and discomfort on his 
guru even while he learns something. Such impolite listeners are unworthy. 
9. Leech - A leech also sucks blood from the body on which it sticks. It is 
used for sucking out contaminated blood from a wound. A listener having such 
attitude acquires vices instead of knowledge from a guru. He also becomes 
 
NandiSootra 
 
Aagam- 44 -NandiSootra 
~ 23 ~ 
Compiled by- Deepratnasagar 
 
instrumental in depleting of the powers of the teacher. Such leech-like listeners are 
unworthy. 
10. Cat - Habitually a cat spills milk, curd, or other eatables in dirt and then 
laps it up. Listeners having such attitude never get lessons directly from the guru. 
They either listen from others or read inauthentic literature and absorb right and 
wrong both. Such listeners are unworthy. 
11. Rat - A creature of this species approaches a pot filled with milk or curd 
and carefully laps up only a little at a time. It also consumes the small quantities 
sticking on the outer walls of the pot. This way it collects what it requires and does 
not spoil the whole lot. A listener having such attitude collects knowledge according 
to his need and capacity. He approaches the guru again to remove doubts or to 
consolidate what he has learned. He avoids monopolizing the guru. He is a worthy. 
12. Cow - There is an incident related to cow. It explains the qualities of a 
listener. A merchant donated a mature cow to four Brahmans who were to share the 
milk it produced. The Brahmans decided that by turn each one of them will milk the 
cow one day. All the four Brahmans were utterly selfish. Each one of them thought 
that he should only milk the cow; the other three must certainly be feeding it. This 
way all of them continued to milk the cow. In absence of feed, the cow died of 
starvation after a few days. The Brahmans did not feel sorry as it was a cow they got 
in donation. They were also not worried about any criticism. In the same way, a 
listener who neither arranges for food for the guru nor serves the guru in any other 
way and only tries to extract scriptural knowledge is unworthy. 
13. Trumpet - This too is an incident given as an example - Once while 
praising Vasudev Shri Krishna, Saudharmendra, in his assembly of gods, mentioned 
two of his qualities - appreciation of virtues and maintaining his prestige. A god from 
the assembly descended to earth for the purpose of testing Shri Krishna. He 
transformed himself into a sick and scrawny dog and lied down on the path on which 
Shri Krishna was to pass. After some time, on his way to behold Bhagavan 
Arishtanemi, Shri Krishna arrived near that spot. The obnoxious stink emanating 
from the sick dog entered his nostrils. The stink was so acute that some of the 
guards accompanying Shri Krishna changed their path and the others covered their 
nostrils with their handkerchiefs. But Shri Krishna knew the nature of the earthly 
body and the changes it under went; without even a trace of aversion he passed 
from near the sick dog and commented - ""See there, how beautiful are the clean and 
brilliantly white teeth in the background of the black body of the dog. As if a pearl 
necklace is lying in a vessel made of black stone."" This comment revealed before the 
god Shri Krishna’s acute sense of appreciation of virtues. He was filled with a feeling 
of respect for Shrikrishna. 
The god disappeared from there and reached Shri Krishna’s stable. He 
eloped with one of the best horses. The guards followed him but invain. At last Shri 
Krishna himself went to recover the horse. When he caught up, the thief said - ""In 
order to recover your horse you will have to fight with me."" Shri Krishna said - ""There 
are numerous types of duels - wrestling, boxing, fencing, etc. Which one you want?"" 
The god replied - ""I want a back-duel. We will fight with our backs."" Shri Krishna said 
- ""It is against my prestige to enter into such a lowly and hateful duel. At no cost I 
would stoop so low. You may take away the horse."" 
On hearing this god appeared in his natural form before Shri Krishna and 
bowing at his feet he explained how he had come to test Shri Krishna. After this he 
 
NandiSootra 
 
Aagam- 44 -NandiSootra 
~ 24 ~ 
Compiled by- Deepratnasagar 
 
presented a divine trumpet to Shri krishna and said - ""This divine trumpet has 
healing qualities. It should be blown every six months. Who ever listen to the deeply 
resonant thunder like sound it emits will be free of all ailments for six months. He will 
also be cured of his old ailments. The reach of its sound is twelve yojans (measure 
of linear distance). Ensure that it is blown only once in six months and its coating is 
not removed because it is only the coating that has the healing power."" 
The trumpet was blown on a specific date. As the god had told wherever its 
sound reached every one became free of all ailments. Shri Krishna gave the trumpet 
to one of his attendants and instructed him to blow only once every six months. 
One day a very sick merchant in some other town heard about the divine 
qualities of the trumpet. He at once came to Dwarika. His bad luck that the trumpet 
had been blown just a day before his arrival. He was disappointed and worried. After 
contemplating for some time he got an inspiration. He went to the guard in charge of 
the trumpet and bribed him to scraping a little coating from the trumpet. The powder 
cured the merchant and he went away satisfied. But this provided the guard with a 
new source of income. Gradually he scraped off all the coating from the trumpet and 
sold it. The trumpet was now devoid of its divine healing power. 
When Shri Krishna got this news he punished the trumpet blower guard and 
exiled him from Dwarika. For public welfare he invoked that god and got another 
trumpet from him. This time he gave it to a capable man of confidence with the 
responsibility to blow it every six months. The instructions were strictly followed and 
the people benefitted. 
This is a metaphoric example. Dwarika depicts the Indian subcontinent. Shri 
Krishna depicts Tirthankar. The god who came to test Shri Krishna depicts fruits of 
pious deeds. Trumpet depicts scriptural knowledge and trumpet-blower-guard 
depicts a shraman. When a shraman blows the trumpet of scriptural knowledge the 
masses are cured of their disease of karma. But the shraman who selfishly misuses 
scriptural knowledge and breaks the prescribed codes gets caught in the cycle of 
rebirths as punishment. Listeners having such attitude are unworthy. The shraman 
who does not selfishly misuses scriptural knowledge and avoids breaking the 
prescribed codes embraces success in the goals of development of the self as well 
as masses. Such listeners are worthy. 
14. Ahir (a trade based caste in India; those who own cattle and deal in milk 
and milk products) - This is also an incident given as an example - An Ahir couple 
goes to the town to sell their cart full of pitchers filled with butter. Reaching the town 
they park their cart and start unloading the pitchers. Due to carelessness of one of 
them, a pitcher fell on the ground and broke. The condensed butter spilled on the 
ground. The husband and wife blamed each other and started quarrelling. During 
this squabble the butter melted and seeped into the sand. Valuable time was wasted 
and by the time they could sell the remaining butter, the day ended. They started 
back for their village. In the darkness of the night they were looted by dacoits. 
Abandoning everything they ran for their life and somehow reached the village. 
In the same way a listener who enters into an argument with his teacher or a 
colleague over some mistake, wastes his own as well as others time. Such listeners 
are unworthy. 
Another Ahir couple faced a similar coincidence. As soon as the pitcher broke 
they begged pardon mutually and at once collected the condensed butter spilled on 
the ground, melted it in a pot, filtered it and filled it back into a new pitcher. Their

Aagam- 44 -NandiSootra 
~ 25 ~ 
Compiled by- Deepratnasagar 
 
selling activity was not disturbed. They sold all their produce in time to return home 
safe before sunset. 
In the smile way a listener who, when committing a mistake, at once begs 
pardon of his guru and colleagues and proceeds to rectify the mistake and resume 
acquiring knowledge, successfully absorbs knowledge and progresses in the 
direction of his goal. Such listeners are worthy. 
THREE TYPES OF CONGREGATION 
A group of listeners assembled to listen to a religious discourse is called a 
congregation about this it is mentioned that- 
[047] MEANING -. In brief it has been said to be of three types - Inaytka, 
Ajnayika and Durvidagdha. 
[048] MEANING -Jnayika - Know this, that a Jnayika Parisliad (a congerga- 
tion of sagacious listeners) is where listeners are virtuous as well as appreciaters of 
virtues; and they reject vices and accept virtues just as a swan rejects water    and 
accepts milk. 
COMMENTARY -The qualities of a Jnayzka Parishad have been explained 
with the help of the example of a swan. Where the lot of listeners is so 
knowledgeable and rational that it can discriminate between virtues and vices and 
consequently reject vices and accept virtues alone is known as Jnayika Parishad. 
[049] MEANING -Ajnayika – 
[050] MEANING -Ajnayika Parishad (a congregation of ignorant listeners) is 
where listeners are immature and puerile like the young of deer, lion and hen and 
uncut and unpolished like rough gem stones direct from a mine. 
COMMENTARY -The naive and impressionable listeners as well as those 
who are rustic but simple can be turned in any desired direction and made cultured. 
Their being rustic or uncultured means they are devoid of vices and virtues both. As 
a rough gem stone excavated from a mine is turned into a shining attractive gem 
after cutting and polishing, a naive but simple listener can be educated and steered 
toward the path of knowledge. 
[051]MEANING -Durvidagdha– 
[052]MEANING -.That congregation is known as a Durvidagdha Parishad 
where the listeners are like a village pundit who is not a complete scholar of any 
subject, avoids learning from some one for the fear of criticism, and always remains 
inflated like a balloon with false pride. 
COMMENTARY -Vidagdha means a scholar, a learned person. Durvidagdha 
is he who considers himself a scholar in spite of not being so. Shallow brooks are 
noisy. Such individuals with bloated ego, apprehensive of their ignorance being 
revealed, become caches of numerous other vices and block their own progress. 
They are unworthy of getting scriptural knowledge. 
Of these three congregations, first is the best, second is medium and third is 
the worst. 
✻THE DISCUSSION ABOUT KNOWLEDGE✻ 
[053] MEANING - Jnana or knowledge is said to be of five types-1. 
Abhinibodhik-jnana, 2.Shrut-jnana, 3.Avadhi-jnana, 4.Manahparyav-jnana and 
5.Kewal-jnana. 
COMMENTARY -Although the author has already written the PRAISE of 
Tirthankars, Ganadhars and era-leaders in the beginning, this verse is also 
 
NandiSootra 
 
Aagam- 44 -NandiSootra 
~ 26 ~ 
Compiled by- Deepratnasagar 
 
considered as praise because it is the first verse of the basic text. In this verse only 
the names of different types of knowledge have been given. The details have been 
discussed later in question-answer style. 
Jnana or knowledge means to know matter and fundamentals in their true 
form. The commentator (Vruttikar) of this scripture has interpreted the word Jnana 
only as the mental means and the process. The data about the form of things is the 
mental means, as is said - to know is knowledge. And the activity through which the 
data about the form of a thing is acquired is known as the, process as is said - the 
process of knowing the form of a thing is knowledge The classical definition is - To 
know the true form of things as a consequence of kshaya or kshayopsham 
(extinction or extinction-cum-suppression) of Jnanavaraniya-karmas (knowledge 
veiling karma) is called knowledge. Of the five types of knowledge mentioned here 
the first four are acquired by extinction-cum-suppression of karma and the fifth by 
extinction of karma. 
The definitions of the five types of knowledge in brief are as follows- 
Abhinibodhik-jnana or Mati-jnana (sensory knowledge) - To know the 
apparent form of things coming before the soul by means of five sense organs and 
mind is called Abhinibodhik-inana. It is popularly known as Mati-jnana. 
Shrut-jnana (scriptural knowledge) - To know by, hearing sound, word, or 
speech is called Shrutjnana. Although this type of knowledge is also received with 
the help of sense organs and the mind, because of the larger involvement of the 
processes of thinkingand contemplating it is mainly considered an activity of the 
mind. There are said to be two classes of Shrut-jnana- 
1. Arth shrut (Word of the Omniscient) - what is propagated by the omniscient 
Arthant after knowing through his direct perception is called Arth Shrut. 
2. Sutra shrut - based on this Word of the Omniscient, compiled as 
aphorisms, what is presented by the Ganadhars is called Sutra shrut. As is said - 
""The Arthant utters the Word (arth) and for the benefit of the religious order the 
Ganadhars collect and compile it in the form of aphorisms (sutra). 
Avadhi-jnana (extra sensory perception of the physical dimension) - the 
knowledge of the tangible and material things acquired by soul without the help of 
sense organs and mind is known as Avadhi-jnana. It has the capacity to see and 
know only material things; the formless things are beyond its capacity. In other 
words, it cannot see or know soul. This type of knowledge has the capacity to 
directly perceive material things on the basis of four parameters (avadhi) of matter, 
space (area), time and view-point. 
Manahparyav-jnana - When the mind thinks of some thing it takes the form of 
that thing; this is known as paryaya (form, variation). The knowledge that perceives 
these transformations taking place within the mind of a sentient being is known as 
manahparyav -jnana. 
Kewal-jnana - The full meaning of this term can be understood best with the 
help of various meanings of the word Kewal. Based on these meanings the definition 
in brief is as follows- 
Kewal means the only - Kewal-jnana is that which when dawns, the former 
four merge with it. 
Kewal  means alone or self reliant - The knowledge which directly perceives 
all things tangible or intangible, having a form or formless, without any help or 
 
NandiSootra 
 
Aagam- 44 -NandiSootra 
~ 27 ~ 
Compiled by- Deepratnasagar 
 
assistance and which is not dependent on any instrument or equipment including the 
mind, sense organs, or body is known as Kewal-jnana. 
Kewal means pure - The four Kshayopashamik jnanas are all pure but purest 
of all is Kewal-jnana. The other four jnanas have traces of passions but Kewal-plana 
is absolutely free of them. 
Kewal means complete - The Kshayopashamik jnanas cannot know all 
possible forms (variations) of a single thing. That complete knowledge which can 
know all forms of all things is called Kewal-jnana. 
Kewal means unlimited - Which is best among all types of knowledge and has 
no limit, is Kewal-jnana. It has limitless capacity and it is perpetual as well. 
Kewal means unveiled - The knowledge which has no veil at all, which is ever 
eternal and perpetual and which comes with the total extinction of the Jnanavaraniya 
Karma is Kewal-jnana. 
Of these five types of knowledge the first two are indirect and the remaining 
three are direct. 
✻DIRECT AND INDIRECT KNOWLEDGE✻ 
. [054] MEANING -The five types of knowledge are divided into two classes. 
They are - Pratyaksh or direct and Paroksh or indirect. 
COMMENTARY -The word Aksh means sentient being or soul. The 
knowledge that is directly acquired by a being or a soul without any outside help is 
called directly perceived knowledge or pratyaksh jnana (direct-knowledge). And that 
which is acquired with the help of the sense organs and the mind is called indirectly 
perceived knowledge or Paroksh jnana (indirect-knowledge). Avadhi-jnana and 
Manahparyav-jnana are partially direct and Kewal jnana is completely direct. 
The sequence - In the five types of knowledge Mati-jnana (sensory 
knowledge) is mentioned first of all because in right or wrong form it always exists 
within all worldly beings. Second in order is Shrut-jnana (scriptural knowledge) which 
with very little effort can be acquired in right or wrong form by every being having 
Mati-jnana? 
Third in order is Avadhi-jnana because it requires special efforts and purity of 
mind and soul. Acquired by the kshayopasham of the contamination of karma 
particles this knowledge, like the former two, can have right and wrong 
manifestations. Fourth in order is Manahparyav-jnana. It requires greater efforts and 
purity of mind and soul and is related more to thoughts or feelings rather than matter. 
Therefore it is acquired only by him who has Samyaktva (a specific state of 
righteousness where right perception and right knowledge start translating into right 
conduct). Kewal-jnana comes fifth and occupies the highest position. It is acquired 
only with complete and absolute purity. 
CLASSIFICATION OF DIRECT-KNOWLEDGE 
[055] MEANING -. Question - What is this Pratyaksh-jnana? 
Answer - Pratyaksh-jnana is said to be of two types-1.Indriya Pratyaksh, and 
2. No-indriya Pratyaksh. 
COMMENTARY -Instead of giving a direct answer or the definition of 
Pratyaksh-jnana the author gives names of its types. He uses this style for a more 
explicit presentation of the subject throughout this work. In the agars many different 
styles have been used according to the demand of the subject such as - discussing 
the attributes, the sources, the areas, etc.

Indriya or a sense organ is the evident indicator of the soul. In other words it is 
through the activity of a sense organ that the existence of the soul becomes evident. 
There are two parts of a sense organ-physical (dravyendriya), mental (bhavendriya). 
The physical sense organ also has two parts - structural (nivritti) and 
operative (upkaran). The structural part has two limbs - one is the visible physical 
structure within the body and the second is a matching subtle structure within the 
soul (this is a dimension that is beyond the normal physical and mental perception) 
made up of soul-sections (atma-pradesh). The joint active ability of these two limbs 
of the structural part is called the operative part. In all beings the outer structures of 
the sense organs are different but the inner structures (within the soul) are similar. 
The mental sense organ is also of two types - ability (labdhi) and utility 
(upayoga). The capacity or power acquired as a consequence of the changes 
manifested within the soul due to the kshayopasham of the knowledge-veiling 
karmas is called ability or labdhi. The activity of acquiring normal and special 
knowledge of the sound, form, qualities, subjects etc. is called utility or upayog. 
The knowledge that is acquired with the help of both these physical and 
mental sense organs is called Indriya Pratyaksh. It cannot be acquired in absence of 
any one of these. 
The prefix 'no' is used here as negation only. Therefore No-indriya Pratyaksh 
means the knowledge which is acquired without the help of the sense organs. 
Generally, mind is also called a No-indriya. But here it has not been used in that 
context. Here No-mdriya Pratyaksh means the knowledge that is directly acquired by 
the soul without any outside help including that from sense organs, mind, light, or 
any other medium or instrument. 
In common man's language the knowledge acquired through sense organs is 
also called direct knowledge. With this in view two other names have been given to 
these two types - Indriya Pratyaksh = Samvyavaharik Pratyaksh (mundanely direct) 
and No-Indrlya Pratyaksh = Paramarthik Pratyaksh (transcendentally direct). 
TYPES OF SAMVYAVAHARIK PRATYAKSH 
[056] MEANING -.Question - What is this Indriya Pratyaksh jnana? 
Answer - Indriya Pratyaksh-jnana is of five types - that which is acquired 
through the sense organ of - hearing (ears), seeing (eyes), smelling (nose), tasting 
(tongue), touching (skin or the whole body). 
COMMENTARY -The five sense organs in the body are the means of 
acquiring knowledge. If we count on the basis of the evolution of these sense organs 
normally the sequence is - touch, taste, smell, seeing and hearing. But here the 
emphasis is on piety and kshayopasham of karma which is the cause of being born 
in aparticular species; therefore the sequence is in reverse order. When piety and 
kshayopasham is of higher degree a soul is born in a species equipped with all the 
five sense organs. As this degree reduces a being is born in a species of graduatly 
decreasing number of sense organs like four, three etc. Here the mention follows this 
order. 
CLASSIFICATION OF NOINDRIYA PRATYAKSH 
[057] MEANING - Question - What is this No-indriya Pratyaksh jnana? 
Answer - No-indriya Pratyaksh jnana is said to be of threetypes - (1) Avadhi 
jnana Pratyaksh, (2) Manah-paryav-jnanaPratyaksh and (3) Kewal-jnana Pratyaksh.

✻AVADHI JNANA✻ 
[058] MEANING - Question - What is this Avadhi-jnana Pratyaksh? 
Answer - Avadhi-jnana Pratyaksh is said to be of two types -                          
(1) Bhavapratyayik and (2) Kshayopashamik. 
COMMENTARY -Of the two types of avadhi-jnana the first one is that which 
automatically and naturally manifests itself at the time birth of a being. It is called 
Bhavapratyayik or associated with birth. The second one is that which is gained by 
endeavors such as practices of discipline, following codes of conduct, observing 
vows, etc. aimed at spiritual purity. It is called kshayopashamik or associated with 
extinction-cum-suppression of karmas. 
[059] MEANING -Question - Who has this Bhavapratyayik avadhi-jnana? 
Answer - Two types of beings have this Bhavapratyayikavadhi-jnana- 1.The 
gods (देव), and 2. The hell beings (नारकी). 
COMMENTARY -Here a doubt may arise - When avadhi-jnana appears 
basically as an effect of kshayopasham how can gods and hell beings have it by 
birth? In fact even in gods and hell beings avadhi-jnana appears as an effect of 
kshayopasham because the souls born as gods and hell beings already have 
kshayopasham but it becomes evident only at the time of birth. Although birth as a 
god or a hell being is a result of the fruition of karmas, the avadhi-jnana in these 
beings is called Bhavapratyayik because it is acquired as one of the fundamental 
attributes of these gates (realms). 
[060] MEANING - Question - Who has this kshayopashamik avadhi-jnana? 
Answer - Two types of beings have this kshayopashamik avadhi-jnana-         
1. Human beings and 2.Animals having five sense organs. 
-Question - What is the cause of this kshayopashamik avadhi-jnana? 
-Answer - The cause of this kshayopashamik avadhi-jnana isthe extinction of 
the avadhi-jnana veiling karmas that haveprecipitated or attained fruition and the 
suppression of thosekarmas that have not precipitated. 
SIX CLASSES OF AVADHI-INANA 
[061] 
MEANING 
-Also, 
the 
avadhi-jnana 
acquired 
by 
an 
ascetic 
havingqualities like right knowledge, perception, and conduct is briefly of six classes-
1. Anugamik, 2.Ananugamik, 3.Vardhaman, 4.Ileeyaman, 5.Pratipatik, and 6. 
Apratipatik, 
COMMENTARY-1.Anugamik or attendant - that which always accompanies or 
follows, as do eyes with a moving man, sun with the sun, and glow with the moon. In 
the same way, that which always accompanies a sage is the Anugamik avadhi Jana. 
2. Ananugamik or non-attendant - the opposite of attendant or that which does 
not accompany or follow. This knowledge is acquired under local circumstances or 
influence and is lost as soon as the individual leaves that place just as a stationary 
source of light does not shift with a moving person. It is called Ananugamik avadhi-
jnana. 
3. Vardhaman or increasing - that which increases. As fuel is added to fire its 
intensity increases. In the same way the avadhi-jnana that keeps on increasing with 
the increasing purity of attitudes is called Vardhaman avadhi-jnana. 
4. Heeyaman or decreasing - Opposite of Vardhaman. The intensity of a fire is 
reduced in absence of fuel; in the same way the avadhi-jnana that keeps on 
 
NandiSootra 
 
Aagam- 44 -NandiSootra 
~ 30 ~ 
Compiled by- Deepratnasagar 
 
decreasing with the increasing impurity of attitudes is called Heeyaman avadhi-
jnana. 
5. Pratipatik or destructible - When the oil in a lamp is finished the flame is 
suddenly extinguished. In the same way the avadhI-jnana that is destroyed all of a 
sudden in absence of inner purity is called Prattpatik avadhi-jnana. 
6. Apratipatik or indestructible - Opposite of destructible. The avadhi-jnana 
that never reaches a state where it is destroyed iscalled Apratipattk avadhi-jnana. It 
continues to exist till Ketval-jnana is attained. 
ANUGAMIK AVADHI-JNANA 
[062] MEANING - Question - What is this Anugamik avadhi-jnana? 
Answer - Anugarnik or attendant avadhi-jnana is said to be of two types-1. 
Antgat (peripheral) and Madhyagat (central). 
Question - What is this Antgat (peripheral) avadhi-jnana? 
Answer - This Antgat (peripheral) avadhi-jnana is of three types-1. Puratah 
Antgat (front-peripheral), 2. Margtah Antgat (rear-peripheral) and 3. Parshvatah 
Antgat (flank-peripheral). 
Question - What is this Puratah Antgat (front-peripheral) avadhi-jnana? 
Answer - While moving, a person having a source of light like small lamp, a 
burning bundle of hay, a burning piece of wood, a phosphorescent gem, a large lamp 
or a pot with burning fire, keeps it ahead of him with his hand or with the help a 
wooden stick, and progresses slowly seeing things ahead of him in the light 
produced. In the same way Puratah Antgat (front-peripheral) avadhi-jnana moves 
along illuminating the area in front. 
Question - What is this Margtah Antgat (rear-peripheral) avadhijnana? 
Answer - While moving, a person having a source of light as mentioned above 
keeps it behind him and progresses slowly seeing things in the light produced. In the 
same way Margtah Antgat (rear-peripheral) avadhi-jnana moves along illuminating 
the area at one's back. 
Question - What is this Parshvatah Antgat (flank-peripheral) avadhi-jnana? 
Answer - While moving, a person having a source of light as mentioned above 
keeps it at his side and progresses slowly seeing things in the light produced. In the 
same way Parshvatah Antgat (rear-peripheral) avadhi-jnana moves along 
illuminating the area at one's side. Depending on its intensity it illuminates one or 
both flanks. This concludes the description of Antagat avadhi-jnana. 
Question - What is this Madhyagat (central) avadhi-jnana? 
Answer - While moving, a person having a source of light like a comet, lamp, 
gems, etc. as mentioned above, lifts it over hishead and progresses slowly seeing 
things in the light produced. In the same way Madhyagat (central) avadhi-jnana 
moves along illuminating the area all around. 
As it is produced due to kshayopasham, avadhi-jnana is a subject of the soul. 
In this context it is to be kept in mind that Anugamik avadhi-jnana is that which 
accompanies the soul during rebirth or which is acquired during one incarnation and 
is not terminated with death. 
The term 'ant (अंत)' besides meaning the end in context of existence also 
means extremity or edge or periphery in context of location. 
In this context the avadhi-jnana that is produced at some specific peripheral 
segment of atma pradeshas or soul-bits (the soul being viewed as divided into 
infinitesimal fractions) is known as Antgat avadhi-jnana. 
 
NandiSootra 
 
Aagam- 44 -NandiSootra

The specific end being defined by the directional prefix such as front, rear, or 
flank-. The central avadhi-jnana is produced at the central segment of the soul-bits. 
Another meaning of 'ant' is the state of completion. In this context the 
knowledge of everything existing up to the end of a specific direction is known as the 
antagat avadhi-jnana related to that direction. 
The ultimate level of this is the madhyagat avadhi-jnana which encompasses 
the knowledge of all things existing up to the ends of all directions. This reveals the 
strange consequences of the levels of kshayopasham. 
THE ATTRIBUTES OF ANTAGAT AND MADHYAGAT 
Question - What specific differences are there between the peripheral and 
central Avadhi-jnana? 
Answer - With the help of Puratah Antagat (front-peripheral) Avadhi-jnana the 
knower (scholar) observes in general and understands in particular all physical 
objectsexisting in an area extending to countable or uncountable yojans in front of 
him. 
With the help of Margatah Antagat (rear-peripheral) Avadhi-jnana the knower - 
(scholar) - observes in general and understands in particular all physical objects 
existing in an area extending to countable or uncountable yojans at his back. 
With the help of Parshvatah Antagat (flank-peripheral) Avadhi-jnana the 
knower (scholar) observes in general and understands in particular all physical 
objects existing in an area extending to countable or uncountable yojans at his 
flanks. 
With the help of Madhyagat (central) Avadhi-jnana the knower (scholar) 
observes and understands through all atmapradeshas (soul-bits) all physical objects 
existing in an area extending to countable or uncountable yojans in all spatial 
directions (toward cardinal and intermediate points of the compass). 
This concludes the description of the attributes of Anugamik Avadhi-jnana. 
The Antagat Avadhi jnana is limited and the Madhyagat is unlimited. The 
Gods, the hell beings and the Tirthankars as a rule naturally acquire Madhyagat 
Avadht-jnana. The beings of the animal world have scope of acquiring only Antagat 
Avadhi-inana. But human beings have a possibility of acquiring both types of 
Anugamik Avadhi-jnana. 
The use of the terms countable and uncountable yojans indicates that in 
context of the area covered there may be many levels of Avadht-jnana. For 
example–the beings of the Ratnaprabha Hell have Avadhi-jnana covering a minimum 
area of three and a half yojans and a maximum area of four yojans; similarly the 
Avadhi-jnana of the gods of the Saudharma Ka1p covers a minimum area of an 
infinitesimal part of an angul (the width of a human finger) and a maximum area 
extending up to the end of the Ratnaprabha Hell. 
ANANUGAMIK AVADHI-INANA 
[063] MEANING -Question - What is this Ananugamik Avadhi-jnana? 
Answer - Ananugamik Avadhi-jnana is as if a person prepares a large area 
and burns a fire there and in the light of this fire moves around and sees the 
illuminated area as far as the reach of his eyes and nothing beyond. Thus 
Ananugamik 
Avadhi jnana is effective only in the area where it has been acquired and 
whiles the person is in that area he sees and knows the physical objects, related or 
 
NandiSootra 
 
Aagam- 44 -NandiSootra 
~ 32 ~ 
Compiled by- Deepratnasagar 
 
unrelated to the area of influence, existing in an area extending to countable or 
uncountable yojans. When he shifts from that area it becomes ineffective. 
This concludes the description of Ananugamik Avadhi-jnana. 
Here kshetra means place and rebirth both. Sambandhit (related or 
connected) means without any blockade; without any obstacle between the subject 
and object. To know such a thing. Asambandhit (unrelated or disconnected) means 
with blockade; with an obstacle between the subject and object. To know such a 
thing. 
VARDHAMAN AVADHI-JNANA 
[064] MEANING -Question - What is this Vardhaman Avadhi jnana? 
Answer - When the areas of spiritual endeavour, in other words thoughts and 
attitudes, are active in the right direction there is an improvement in the right conduct 
and as aconsequence the purity of conduct increases. This purity expands the 
Avadhi-jnana acquired by the soul in all directions. This expanding or increasing 
Avadhi-jnana is known as Vardhaman Avadhi-jnana. 
COMMENTARY -Jain philosophy lays more stress on the purity of thoughts 
and attitude than the ritual practices. No matter how immaculate and correct are the 
ritual practices, in absence of the purity of attitude and sincerity of endeavour neither 
there is a development in knowledge nor an increase in purity of the soul. On the 
contrary with the cleansing of feelings or attitude the soul becomes purer. In other 
words there is a kshayopasham (suppression-cum-extinction) of the veils covering 
the soul followed by continued increase in knowledge. 
THE MINIMAM SCOPE OF AVADHI-JNANA 
[065] MEANING -The minimum scope of Avadhi-jnana is equivalent to the 
minimum area occupied by a three samaya (the ultimate fraction of time) old micro-
panag being or a dormant microorganism having intake-capacity. 
COMMENTARY -Moss, fungus, mildew, etc. come under the class of panag 
beings. According to the Jain biology these come under thei class of nigod or 
dormant beings. A snow ball like cluster of micro-beings or a cluster like body having 
infinite number of individual micro-beings living together is called nigod beings. 
There are two classes of these nigod beings - badar or gross and sukshma or 
tiny. Here the tiny or the micro-nigod has been cited. The micro-nigod is invisible to 
the naked eye. Its existence becomes apparent only in the cluster form. The life span 
of such beings is infinitely short. Samaya is the ultimate fraction of time, something 
even smaller than a nano second. A micro-nigod being reaches its minimum but full 
growth within three samaya. The minimal scope of Avadhi-jnana is so infinite simal. 
THE MAXIMUM SCOPE OF AVADHI-JNANA 
[066] MEANING -The maximum scope of Avadhi-jnana is equivalent to an 
area that can be occupied by all or maximum number of all types (gross and micro) 
of fire-bodied beings in space, without a gap, in all directions. 
COMMENTARY -The number of fire-bodied beings in this universe is 
minimum as compared to that of the other immobile beings. These are of four types - 
aparyapt-sukshma (micro-being that has not fully developed), paryapt-sukshma (fully 
developed micro-being), aparyapt-badar (gross being that has not fully developed) 
and paryapta-badar (fully developed gross being). 
These beings are spread all over the lokakash or the inhabited universe. It is 
believed that the maximum number of this type of beings was during the period of 
Bhagavan Ajitnath. 
 
NandiSootra 
 
Aagam- 44 -NandiSootra

If the space is divided into infinitely small sections or space points and one 
such being is placed on each one of these space points; when the inhabited universe 
is filled the remaining beings are spilled over into such space points in the alokakash 
or uninhabited universe; then the total area covered makes up the maximum scope 
of Avadhi-jnana. This is a hypothetical example to give an idea of the vastness of the 
maximum scope of Avadhi-jnana in conceivable terms. 
THE AVERAGE SCOPE OF AVADHI JNANA 
[067] MEANING -An Avadhi-jnani (one who possesses such knowledge) with 
a capacity to know infinite simal part of a standard angul in terms of area also has 
the capacity to know infinitesimaldivision of avalika (a micro-unit, of time made up by 
uncountable units of samaya. Also a countable or a finite number of avalikas make 
one shvas or the time taken by one normal inhalation) in terms of time. 
In the same way if his capacity is to know countable fractions of an angul, he 
also has the capacity to know countable fractions of an avalika. However, if he 
knows one angul area he knows slightly less than an avaltka and if he knows one 
avalika he knows only prithaktva (an arithmetical term which means second to ninth 
divisions of a thing divided into ten equal parts) angul. 
[068] MEANING -If he knows an arms length in terms of area, he knows a 
little less than a muhurt (48 minutes) in terms of time. If he knows a little less than a 
day in terms of time, he knows two miles in terms of area. If he knows one yojan in 
terms of area, he knows divas prithaktva (two to nine days) in terms of time. If he 
knows a little less than a fortnight in terms of time, he knows 25 yojans in terms of 
area. 
[069] MEANING -If he knows Bharat kshetra (a geographical area according 
to Jain geography) in terms of area, he knows 15 days in the past, the present and 
the future in terms of time. If he knows the Jambu continent in terms of area, he 
knows more than one month in the past, the present and the future in terms of time. 
If he knows the complete area inhabited by human beings (the earth) in terms 
of area, he knows one year in the past, the present and the future in terms of time. If 
he knows Ruchak kshetra (the over all area where beings exist according to Jain 
cosmology) in terms of area, he knows prithaktva-varsh (2 to 9 years) in the past, the 
present and the future in terms of time. 
[070] MEANING -If in terms of time he knows countable large units of time 
period, in terms of area also he knows up to countable continents and seas. If he 
knows uncountable large units of time period, in terms of area he knows up to 
countable or uncountable continents and seas. 
[071] MEANING -With the increase in time there certainly is an increase in all 
the four parameters of matter, space (area), time, and bhava (thought, feeling, 
perspective, viewpoint, alternates, mode, etc.). With the increase in area there may 
or may not be an increase in time. With the increase in matter and its modes there 
may or may not be an increase in area and time. (This is about the increase of 
capacities in different parameters.) 
WHICH IS SUBTLER THAN WHAT? 
[072] MEANING -Time is infinitesimal or subtle but the area or space is 
subtler than time because if the space points covering therunning length of the area 
covered by an angul are counted it will take uncountable cycles of time. 
[073] MEANING -This concludes the description of Vardhaman Avadhi-jnana. 
 
NandiSootra 
 
Aagam- 44 -NandiSootra

Compiled by- Deepratnasagar 
 
COMMENTARY -Kshetra (space) and time are formless. Kshetra (area) 
means the place or area in the empty space occupied by something. Time is the gap 
between two incidents. As these are formless they are beyond the scope of Avadhi-
jnana. But as these are the parameters of measurement, everything within the scope 
of Avadhi-jnana is covered by these parameters. In other words everything falling 
within the scope of these parameters of time and space is subject of Avadhi-jnana. 
As space has been shown to be subtler than time, matter is subtler than 
space because a space point is occupied by one skandh (a bunch of particles of 
matter, atom) of matter which in turn is composed of infinite paramanus (ultimate 
particles). Bhava (mode) is even subtler than matter because every ultimate particle 
has infinite modes with reference to shape, smell, taste and touch. 
The maximum or ultimate Avadhi-jnana is acquired just a moment 
(antarmuhurt) before attaining Kewal-jnana and it gives power to see even an 
ultimate particle. 
HEEYAMAN AVADHI-INANA 
[074] MEANING -Question - What is this Heeyaman Avadhi jnana? 
Answer - When an avirat samyakdrishti being (the being who has acquired 
right perception but is not completely detached) or an ascetic observing conduct of 
partial or complete detachment, involved in mean or pervert thoughts, suffers pain or 
sorrow as a consequence of such impious involvements, and consequently his 
conduct becomes faulty, then from every direction and in every way there is a 
decline in the existing levelof Avadhi-jnana. This declining Avadhi-jnana is known 
asHeeyaman Avadhi-jnana. 
COMMENTARY -The purity gained by kshayopasham is the cause of Avadhi-
jnana. Any contact with tainted thoughts and the disturbed mental state due to 
anguish tarnish purity nullify kshayopasham and reduce Avadhi-jnana. Spiritual 
endeavour and mental peace help gain purity of soul and increase Avadhi-jnana. 
PRATIPATI AVADHI-INANA 
[075] MEANING -Question - What is this Pratipati Avadhi jnana? 
Answer - The jnana that is lost after seeing a minimum area equivalent to an 
uncountable fraction of an angul or at any point during the gradual progress of 
seeing areas equivalent to a numerical divisions of an angul, balagra (the edge of a 
singlehair) or balagra prithaktva (2 to 9), leekh (egg of a louse) orleekh prithaktva, 
yuka (louse) or yuka prithaktva, yav (a grain ofbarley) or yav prithaktva, angul (width 
of a finger) or angulprithaktva, paad (foot) or paad prithaktva, vitasti (one hand) 
orvitasti prithaktva, ratni (arm's length) or ratni prithaktva, kukshi (two arm's length) 
or kukshi prithaktva, dhanush (fourarm's length) or dhanush prithaktva, kos (two 
miles) or kosprithaktva, yojan (four kos or eight miles) or yojan prithaktva, yojanshat 
(one hundred yojans) or yojanshat prithaktva, yojansahasra (one thousand yojans) 
or yojansahasra prithaktva, yojanshatsahasra (one hundred thousand yojans) 
oryojanshatsahasra prithaktva, yojankoti (ten million yojans) oryojankoti prithaktva, 
yojankoti-koti (one hundred trillion yojans)or yojankoti-koti prithaktva, sankhyat yojan 
(countable yojans, a very large but still countable number) or sankhyat 
yojanprithaktva, asankhyat yojan (uncountable yojans) or asankhyatyojan prithaktva, 
or a maximum of the whole habitable universeis known as Pratipati Avadhi-jnana. 
COMMENTARY -Pratipati means that which falls. As a lamp is suddenly 
extinguished by a gust of wind so does Pratipati Avadhi-jnana vanish at once, and 
 
NandiSootra 
 
Aagam- 44 -NandiSootra

not gradually? This knowledge can be acquired suddenly at any moment during a life 
time and can be lost in the same manner. 
APRATIPATI AVADHI ]NANA 
[076] MEANING -Question - What is this Apratipati Avadhi-jnana? 
Answer - That indestructible knowledge in light of whicheven a single space 
point in alok or alokakash (the empty spacebeyond the inhabited universe) can be 
seen and known is knownas Apratipati Avadhi-jnana. 
COMMENTARY -Apratipati Avadhi-jnana has been explained withthe help of 
its maximum or ultimate capacity. Alokakash is devoid of i matter whereas the 
subject of Avadhi-jnana is matter or tangiblematter. The ultimate capacity of Avadhi-
jnana is that, with its help every existing matter in the inhabited universe can be seen 
and known. The Avadhi-jnana that knows even a single space point beyond that, in 
the alokakash, is classified as Apratipati. This is because once it attains this ultimate 
state it does not decline. It is singularly progressive and within antarmuhurt (less 
than 48 minitus.) gives rise to Kewal-jnana. 
AVADHI-JNANA WITH REFERENCE TO THE FOUR PARAMETERS 
[077] MEANING -In brief this Avadhi-jnana is said to be of four types, viz.          
(1) With reference to matter, (2) with reference to area or space, (3) with reference to 
time, and (4) with reference to mode. This are- 
With reference to mafter - Avadhi-jnani sees and knows a minimum of infinite 
types and a maximum of all types of tangible matter. 
With reference to area or space - Avadhi-jnani sees and knows a minimum 
area equivalent to an inexpressible fraction of an angul and a maximum area 
equivalent to the uncountable space points occupied by the habited universe in the 
space. 
 With reference to time - Avadhi-jnani sees and knows a minimum time span 
equivalent to an inexpressible fraction of one avalika and a maximum time span 
equivalent to uncountable number of ascending and descending time cycles of the 
past and future. 
With reference to mode - Avadhi-jnani sees and knows a minimum of infinite 
modes and a maximum also of infinite modes. However, he only knows only an 
infinitesimal fraction of the total number of modes. 
COMMENTARY -This paragraph encompasses the minimum and maximum 
limits of Avadhi-jnana. The totality of the modes or alternatives is beyond even this 
ultimate Avadhi-jnana. This is conveyed by the use of infinite both with minimum and 
maximum. Even infinite has infinite levels and as such there is a vast difference in 
terms of capacity in the minitnum infinite and maximum infinite. However, the 
expanse of modes is so great that to know it in its totality is beyond the scope of 
Avadhi jnana. Although an Avadhi-jnani knows infinite modes or alternatives of 
matter, he can at best see and know only an infinitesimal fraction of the total number 
of modes. 
CONCLUSION 
[078] MEANING -This Avadhi-jnana is said to be of two types – bhava-
pratyayik (birth related) and gunapratyayik (virtue related) and having numerous 
categories in relation to matter, space, time and mode.

WITH AND WITHOUT AVADHI-JNANA 
[079] MEANING -Hell-beings, gods and nrthankars are not without Avadhi-
jnana; which means they are with Avadhi-jnana and surely see all around. Other 
than these all see only partially. 
[080] MEANING -This concludes the description of Avadhi-jnana. 
COMMENTARY -Hell-beings, gods, and Tirthankars, these three possess 
Avadhi-jnana as a natural rule and see in all directions. Animals and men even after 
acquiring Avadhi-jnana can only see partially. 
A Tirthankar possesses Avadhi-jnana during his Chhadmastha (a person in 
the state of bondage or one who has a finite cognition, not omniscience) state. This 
Avadhi-jnana has potency depending on the place of descent or ascent. If they 
descend from any of the 26 abodes of gods or the 9 abodes of gods located at the 
edge of the universe, they come with a high potency Avadhi-jnana. If they ascent 
from the first three hells they possess, during their immature state, a low potency 
Avadhi-jnana matching that belonging to the particular hell; however as soon as they 
attain the state of maturity this develops into the high potency Avadhi-jnana. The 
Avadhi-jnana of the Tirthankars is indestructible. 
✻MANAH-PARYAVA-JNANA✻ 
[081] MEANING -Question - What is this Manahparyava jnana? Is this 
knowledge acquired by human beings or non-human beings (gods, hell beings etc?) 
Bhagavan replied–Gautam! This knowledge is acquired only by human beings 
and not by non-human beings. 
 Question - When you say that it is acquired by humanbeings do you mean 
the sammurchim humans or the garbhavyutkrantik (born out of womb, placental?) 
Answer - Gautam! It is acquired only by the garbhavyutkrantik humans and 
not by the sammurchim i humans. 
COMMENTARY -The sarnmurchim human is a conceptual micro being that 
originate in the excreta (urine, stool, resspiration, etc.) of the normal placental 
humans. Its size is as small as an infinitesimal fraction of an angul. It is insensate, 
irrational, innocent and incomplete and has a momentary life. (For a detailed 
description consult Prajnapana Sutra - first chapter) 
Question - When you say that it (Manah-paryav-jnana) is acquired by 
garbhavyutkrantik human beings do you mean those belonging to karmabhumi (land 
of activity), akarmabhumi (land of inactivity or enjoyment), or the middle continents? 
Answer - Gautam! It is acquired only by the placental human beings belong to 
karmabhumi and not by the placental human beings belonging to akarma- bhumi or 
or middle continents. 
COMMENTARY -The area where activities related to asi (sword), masi (ink), 
krishi (agriculture), vanijya (commerce), kala (arts), shilp (crafts), rajaniti (politics) 
and teerth (religious organisation comprising of ascetics and citizens) exist is called 
karmabhumi; likethe earth we live on. The areas where these activities do not exist 
are called akarmabhumi. The human beings living in akarmabhum, i live on the 
produce of the kalpavriksha (wish-fulfilling trees). 
The 30 akarmabhumis and the 56 middle continents fall under the class of 
akarmabhumis or bhog-bhumis (the lands of enjoyment). (For a detailed description 
consult Jivabhigam Sutra and the Yugalia chapter of Jambudveep Prajnapti)

bhumi inhabitant garbhaj human beings do you mean those with a life-span of 
countable (a finite number of) years or those with a life-span of uncountable years? 
Answer - Gautam! It is acquired only by the karmabhumi inhabitant placental 
human beings with a life-span of countable years and not by those with a life-span of 
uncountable years. 
The Measurement of Time 
Jains have also worked out the minute, detailed and scientific division of time. 
This has two sections – One is countable time and the other is metaphoric time. 
NUMERICAL TIME: -[1] Indivisible unit of time= 1 Samaya, [2] 
InnumerableSamaya = 1Avalika, [3] Numerical Avalika= 1 Exhalation or 1 Inhalation, 
[4]1In- halation + 1 Exhalation= 1 Pran, [5] 7 Pran= 1 Stok, [6]7 Stok= 1 Lav, [7] 
77Lav = 1 Muhurt, [8]30 Muhurt= 1Day and Night /24 hours, [9]15 Day and Night= 1 
Fortnight, [10] 2 Fortnight = 1Month, [11] 2 Months=1 Season, [12]3 Season= 1 Ayan 
or 1/2 year, [13]2Ayan = 1 Year, [14]5Years= 1Yug (half a decade), [15]20Yug= 1 
Century (100 years), [16]10Century= 1 Millennium (1000 years), [17]100 Millenniu = 
1Lakshabdi (100000 years), [18] 84 Lakshabdi= 1Purvang(84 x 1lac years), [19] 84 
Lac Purvang = 1 Purva (84 lac x84lac Years) 
After the purva' there are twenty five units more. Each unit is amultiple of 84, 
00,000 and the previous unit. The last such unit of thefinite number in this series is 
known as Sheersh Prahelika. It contains 54 numbers and 140 zeros. 
Metaphoric Time Scale 
This is the period of time beyond the scope of numbers ormathematics. As 
such, it is measured metaphorically. Its smallest'unit is Palyopam. 
The definition of Palyopam available in Jainscriptures is as follows:- 
Dig a cup shape ditch measuring 1 yojan (approx. 8 miles) on all sides. Fill it 
with the miniscule hair of manfrom Uttar kuru. It would be so tightly packed that air or 
water maynot find a passage within. Now start taking out one hair everyhundred 
years. The time taken in emptying this ditch is termed asPalyopam. 
1 thousand trillion Palyopam = 1 Sagaropam 
1 thousand trillion Sagaropam = 1 Utsarpini or 1 Avasarpini 
2 thousand trillion Sagaropam = 1 time cycle, 
Question - When you say that it (Manah-paryav-jnana) is 'acquired by the 
karmabhumi inhabitant placental human beings with a finite life-span do you mean 
those who are fully developed or those who are under-developed? 
Answer - Gautam! It is acquired only by the karmabhumi inhabitant placental 
human beings with a finite life-span who are fully developed and not by those who 
are under-developed. 
COMMENTARY -Placental human beings belonging to karmabhumi with a 
life-span of countable years are of two types - paryapt (fully developed) and aparyapt 
(under-developed). As a consequence of fruition of karma, to reach the state of full 
development of all faculties associated with life is called paryapti. Aparyapt is its 
opposite or not fully developed. Paryapti means maturity in terms of capacities of all 
faculties associated with life. There are six types of paryaptis- 
Aahar-paryapti - The maturity or full development of the capacity of a being 
to accept eatables and convert them into the required basic components of form, 
taste, smell etc. is known as Ahar-paryapti or the mature or fully developed capacity 
to eat.

Sharir-paryapti - The maturity or full development of the capacity of a being 
to transform the basic components of form, taste, smell etc., extracted from food, into 
the basic constituents of the body such as bone, flesh, marrow, etc. is known as 
Sharir-paryapti or the fully developed capacity of body formation. 
Indriya-paryapti - The maturity or full development of the capacity of a being 
to absorb matter particles and build specific sense organ or organs, complete and 
active, with the help of anabhog-nivartit-yoga-shakti (this is the natural cohesive 
power of a being that provides a neutral bond between matter particles) is known as 
Indriya-paryapti or the fully developed capacity of sense-organ formation. 
Shvasocchavas-paryapti - The maturity or full development of the capacity 
of a being to inhale and exhale suitable matter particles is known as Shvasocchavas-
paryaptt or the fully developed capacity of breathing. 
Bhasha-paryapti - The maturity or full development of the capacity of a being 
to accept matter particles of acoustic category and express them in lingual form is 
known as Bhasha-paryapti or the fully developed capacity of lingual expression. 
Manah-paryapti - The maturity or full development of the capacity of a being 
to accept matter particles of manovargana (a class of particles connected with 
thought process) and convert them into man (mind, the entity responsible for the 
thought process) is known as Manah-paryapti or the fully developed capacity of 
thinking. 
Of these the first occurs at the first samaya (the infinitesimal unit of time) after 
birth. The remaining five are attained within antarmuhurt depending on the realm of 
birth. Beings with a single sense organ can attain the first four. Beings with two to 
four sense organs as well as asanjni-panchendriya (five sensed beings devoid of 
mind) can attain first five. Human beings can attain all six. When a being is short of 
the development specified for a particular class it is called aparyapt or under-
developed. Manah-paryav-jnana is acquired only by such fully developed human 
being and not by an underdeveloped one. 
SPIRITUAL INSIGHT 
Question - When you say that it (Manah-paryav-jnana) is acquired by fully 
developed, karmabhumi inhabitant, placental human beings of finite life-span do you 
mean thosewith samyak-drishti, mithya-drishti, or mishra-drishti? 
Answer - Gautam! It is acquired only by the fully developed karmabhumi 
inhabitant placental human beings of finite life-span with samyak-drishti and not by 
those with mithya-drishti, or mishra-drishti. 
COMMENTARY -With respect to drishti (spiritual insight) there are i three 
classes of human beings - samyak-drishti, mithya-drishti andMishra-drishti. These 
are defined as follows: 
1. Samyak-drishti - A person whose insight, feelings, thought i process, etc. 
work in the direction of truth and are aimed at the fundamentals propounded by the 
Veetaraga (the detached one) is known as samyak-drishti manushya or a man with 
right insight. Inother words a man with right, insight has faith in truth and 
fundamentals. 
2. Mithya-drishti - As opposed to the right, one who has faith in and is 
dogmatic about falsity and unreal fundamentals is known as mithya-drishti or a man 
with false insight. 
3. Mishra-drishti - A wavering and aimless fool who neither can accept truth 
nor reject falsity is called mishra-drishti or a man with confused insight.

PERFECT, IMPERFECT, AND MIXED  
Question - When you say that it (Manahparyav-jnana) is acquired by the 
samyak-drishti (having right insight), fully developed, karmabhumi inhabitant, 
placental human beings offinite life-span do you mean those who are samyat, 
asamyat or samyatasamyat. 
Answer - Gautam! It is acquired only by the samyak-drishti, fully developed, 
karmabhumi inhabitant, and placental human beings of finite life-span who are 
samyat and not by those who are asamyat or samyatasamyat. 
COMMENTARY -Those who have abandoned everything and have gained 
the conduct of the detached through extinction or extinction-cum-suppression of 
conduct veiling karmas are known as samyat or the perfect ones; such as 
accomplished ascetics. 
As against this, those who are imperfect in observation of codes and critical 
review (pratyakhyan) and who are avirat (without self-discipline) samyak-drishti at 
the fourth Gunashthan are known as asamyat or the imperfect ones; such as 
ordinary ascetics. 
Those who are not completely but only partially free of the five causes of 
karmic bondage including himsa (aggression) are known as samyatasamyat; such 
as shravak (a lay person who has accepted the prescribed code of conduct and tries 
to observe it). 
APRAMATT AND PRAMATT 
Question - When you say that it (Manah-paryav-jnana) is acquired by the 
samyat (accomplished), samyak-drishti (having right insight), fully developed, 
karmabhumi inhabitant, placental human beings of finite life-span do you mean those 
who are pramatt or those who are apramatt. 
Answer - Gautam! It is acquired only by the samyat, samyak-drishti, fully 
developed, karmabhumi inhabitant, and placental human beings of finite life-span 
who are apramatt and not by those who are pramatt. 
COMMENTARY -One who has reached the seventh gunasthan (level of purity 
of soul), who is incessantly involved in spiritual activity, rising above the static and 
negligent activities like sleep, who steadily progresses in the stream of pious attitude, 
thought and feeling, is called apramatt-samyat (accomplished and alert). 
He who is not absolutely free of the traces of non-righteous attitudes including 
residual passions, somnolence, opprobriuM, grief, indifference and mirth is called 
pramatt-samyat (accomplished but negligent); such as jinkalpi (an ascetic living in 
complete isolation) and other shramans who adhere to strict observance of higher 
levels of discipline. 
SPECIAL POWERS 
Question - When you say that it (Manahparyay-jnana) is acquired by the 
apramatt (alert), samyat, samyak-drishti, fully developed, karmabhumi inhabitant, 
and placental human beings of finite life-span do you mean those who are endowed 
with special powers or those who are not endowed with special powers? 
Answer. -Gautam! It is acquired only by the apramatt-samyat, samyak-drishti, 
fully developed, karmabhumi inhabitantand placental human beings of finite life-span 
who are endowed with special powers and not by those who are not endowed with 
special powers. 
COMMENTARY -Those alert practicers who have acquired Avadhi-jnana, 
knowledge of the subtle canons, supreme intelligence, andother special powers

namely: 
ambrosia 
aharak-vaikriya 
labdhi, 
vtpul 
tejoleshya, 
janghacharan, 
vidyacharan, etc. are the 'onesendowed with special powers'. Some of these powers 
are as follows:- 
Atishayini buddhi (supreme intelhgence) - This is of three types – 
(a) Koshtak buddhi - the capacity to retain all the listened scriptural knowledge 
in memory. 
(b) Padanusarini buddhi – The capacity to understand the complete chapter or 
lesson by listening tojust one stanza. 
(c) Beej buddhi - the capacity to understand all themeanings of all related 
texts by understanding the meaning of justone stanza. 
Ambrosia labdhi - The person with this power can cureIncurable diseases 
with a mere touch. 
Janghacharan labdhi - The power to transport oneselfquickly to any desired 
destination; aerial transportation.There are numerous such powers that can be 
acquired with thehelp of discipline and austerities. Some of these are audayik 
orcaused by fruition of past karmas, others are kshayopashamik orcaused by 
suppression-cum-extinction of related karmas, and still others are kshayih or caused 
by extinction of related karmas. A detailed discussion of such powers (labdhis) is 
available in the 20th shatak of Bhagavati Sutra. Commentator Malayagiri has also 
discussed this topic in his commentary (tika-टीका). 
Those who have not been able to acquire any such powers are the `ones not 
endowed with special powers'. 
The above mentioned nine requirpments can be divided into four categories - 
paryaptak, garbhaj, and manushya related to matter; karmabhumij. Related to area 
or space; life-span of samkhyat years related to time; and Samyak-drishti, samyat, 
apramatt, having labdht related to attitude or mode. Thus only when all these 
requirements related to matter, space, time, and mode are met the process of 
kshayopasham of the knowledge veiling karmas takes place and Manah-paryav 
jnana is acquired, otherwise not. 
TYPES OF MANAH-PARYAV JNANA 
[082] MEANING -In terms of potency this Manah-paryav jnana is of two types 
- riju (lesser) mati and vipul (greater) mati. These in turn have four categories each - 
(1) with reference to matter, (2) with reference to area or space, (3) with reference to 
time, and (4) with reference to mode. 
(1) With reference to matter - a rujumati sees and knows infinite skandhas 
(blocks) having infinite sections or parts generally or in brief and specially or in detail; 
a vipul mati seesand knows these blocks in slightly greater detail, with slightly better 
clarity and with a little more certainty. 
(2) With reference to area or space - a rijumati sees and knows an area 
equivalent to a minimum of inexpressible fraction of an angul and a maximum of up 
to the lowest subtle level of Ratnaprabha hell towards nadir, the highest level of the 
Jyotish ehakra, and all human inhabited areas in other spatial directions including 
fifteen karmabhumis, thirty akarmabhumis, and fifty six intermediate islands existing 
in adhai-dveep-samudra (two and a half continents and oceans). 
He also knows the thoughts and feelings within the minds of fully developed 
sentient  five-sensed beings living in the said areas. A vipul mati sees these thoughts 
and feelings in slightly greater detail, with slightly better clarity and with a little more 
certainty covering two and a half angul more area. 
 
NandiSootra 
 
Aagam- 44 -NandiSootra 
~ 41 ~ 
Compiled by- Deepratnasagar 
 
(3) With reference to time - a rujumati sees and knows into the past and the 
future up to a minimum as well as maximum span of inexpressible fraction of a 
palyopam (a vast conceptual unit of time) ; a vipul mati sees and knows the same in 
slightly greater detail, with slightly better clarity and with a little more certainty. 
(4) With reference to mode - a rujumati sees and knows infinite modes but 
only an infinitesimal fraction of each such mode; a vipul mati sees and knows the 
same inslightly greater detail, with slightly better clarity and with a little more 
certainty. 
COMMENTARY -These two divisions of Manah-paryav jnana are qualitative 
only. In brief it can be said that while a rijumati sees and knows only generally, a 
vipul mati sees and knows the same subject specially. In other words he sees and 
knows without any doubt and with more clarity and in greater detail. 
There is a difference of opinion among scholarly acharyas with regard to 
'seeing' and 'knowing' because the activity related to manah-paryav-jnana is 
knowing, not seeing but here the Prakrit term pasai has been used, which means - to 
see. 
In simple terms this ambiguity can be explained as - to see the thoughts that 
have been manifested as particles of manovargana (thought category) and to know 
those which have not yet been so manifested but are still at the thought level only 
Matter - Jam metaphysics has discussed matter minutely. It defines blocks or 
atoms as constituents of matter and ultimate particles as constituents of atoms; 
going further it defines different properties and variations of ultimate particles. Not 
only this, it has also dealt with in great details the much larger expanse of inhabited 
space and the empty space beyond the visible planetary system. 
Space - Taking the eight ruchak pradesh, located at the middle of the 
inhabited space, as the central point six cardinal points and four intermediate points 
of the compass divide the outer space. In this middle section are situated two and a 
half continents and two oceans. This circular area is also known as the time zone. Its 
length and breadth is 4.5 million yojans. This is the living area of human beings. 
Time - Jam metaphysics has also discussed time minutely and in great detail. 
The ultimate fractional unit of time which is described as the inexpressible fraction of 
one second is known as samaya. Beyond the countable are the much larger 
conceptual units like palyopam, sagaropam, etc. 
The three common categories of time - past, present and future - have also 
been elaborated by dividing them into these minute and vast units. A manah-paryav-
jnani not only clearly sees and knows the thoughts (inanah-paryaya or modes of 
mind) of the present but also belonging to the past and the future up to an 
inexpressible fraction of one palyopam. 
Mode - The Bridge between soul and body is mind. According to the Jain 
theory, mind is constituted of eight minute particles of manovargana (the category of 
subtle particles that is responsible for the formation and activity of the subtle-mind; 
mentatic particles). The driving force of the process of interaction between soul and 
matter, made up - of mental activities like attitudes, thoughts, alternatives, decisions, 
is known as bhava. The activities of soul are beyond comprehension. 
However, when they bring about changes in the mentatic particles through 
thoughts, decisions and alternatives they are manifested in the form of bhava. This is 
the subject of manah-paryav-jnana. The ever changing forms of bhava are called 
paryaya or modes.

The difference between avadhi jnana and manah-paryav-jnana:- 
1. As compared to avadhi-jnana, manah-paryav-inana is more refined. 
2. The Scope of avadhi-jnana is the spread of the three worlds. The scope of 
manah-paryav-jnana is limited to the mental activities of fully developed sentient 
beings. 
3. Avadhi-jnana can be acquired by beings of all the four dimensions. Manah 
paryav-jnana can be acquired only by the ones having special powers. 
4. The subject of avadhi-jnana is tangible matter with a few alternative modes. 
As compared to that, the subject of manah-paryau-jnana is infinitely minute. 
5. Avadht-jnana can turn into perversion due to the rise of attitude of falsity. 
The chance of rise of attitude of falsity is completely eliminated once manah-paryav-
inana is acquired. 
6. Avadht-Jnana can accompany the soul to its reincarnation. Manah-paryav-
jnana is confined to the particular birth only, just like discipline and austerities. 
CONCLUSION 
[083] MEANING -Manah-paryav-jnana reveals the meaning of the thought 
activity (thoughts, feelings, alternatives, decisions etc. rising every moment) going on 
in the minds of beings living in the lands inhabited by humans. The causes of rise of 
this knowledge are virtues (clemency, discipline, austerities etc.) and it is acquired 
only by a person or a soul that is perfect in the prescribed conduct. 
[084] MEANING -This concludes the description of manah-paryav-jnana. 
COMMENTARY - Here the term Jan' does not specify humans alone it has 
been used for all sentient beings. Perfect in the prescribed conduct means those 
who have reached the level of apramatt-samyat (the alert perfect ones, as described 
earlier). 
✻KEWAL-JNANA✻ 
[085] MEANING -Question - What is this Kewal-jnana? 
Answer - Kewal-jnana is said to be of two types–bhavasth Kewal-jnana and 
siddha Kewal-jnana. 
Question - What is this bhavasth Kewal-jnana? 
Answer - Bhavasth Kewal-jnana is also of two types–sayogi bhavasth Kewal-
jnana and ayogi bhavasth Kewal-jnana. 
Question - What is this sayogi bhavasth Kewal-jnana? 
Answer - Sayogi bhavasth Kewal-jnana is also of twotypes - pratham samaya 
sayogi bhavasth Kewal-jnana andapratham samaya sayogi bhavasth Kewal-jnana. 
These are alsoknown as charam samaya sayogi bhavasth Kewal-jnana andacharam 
samaya sayogi bhavasth Kewal-jnana. 
Question - What is this ayogi bhavasth Kewal-jnana? 
Answer - Ayogi bhavasth Kewal-jnana is also of two types - pratham samaya 
ayogi bhavasth Kewal-jnana and aprathamsamaya ayogi bhavasth Kewal-jnana. 
These are also known ascharam samaya ayogi bhavasth Kewal-jnana' and 
acharamsamaya ayogi bhavasth Kewal-jnana. 
This concludes the description of bhavasth Kewal-jnana. 
COMMENTARY -The four Ghati-Karmas (Karmas that have a vitiating effect 
upon the qualities of soul) act as veils on the soul. These are jnanavaraniya (that 
veils true knowledge), darshanavaraniya (that veils true perception), mohaniya (that 
tempts soul towards fondness for things), and antaraya (that acts as an impediment

to a man's pursuits including realisation of his human, moral and spiritual goals). The 
state where all these are completely destroyed and consequently the soul becomes 
absolutely refined, pureand radiant and acquires infinite knowledge and perception,is 
known as Kewal-jnana (omniscience). Once attained, 
Kewal-jnana is never destroyed. There is no darkness in the universe that can 
dim the light of Kewal-jnana. This is the highest level of knowledge and can be 
acquired only as human being. It is with a beginning but without an end, and is ever 
uniform. 
Although the Kewal-jnana of Arihant Bhagavan and Siddha Bhagavan is the 
same, it is still said to be of two types. The Kewal-jnana resident in a human body 
with life-span is said to be bhavasth Kewal-jnana. In other words, Kewal-jnana 
acquired by a soul that has not yet completed its life-span in the human body is 
bhavasth Kewal-jnana. Still simpler definition is - the Kewal-jnana of a living human 
being is called bhavasth Kewal-jnana. 
This is further divided into two classes - sayogi and ayogi. The power of the 
soul or chetana vibrates soul-bits (The soul is formless and indivisible. However, in 
order to understand its activity in our terminology it is conceptually divided into 
infinite simal sections called atrna-pradesh or soul-sections. For ease we shall call 
them soul-bits). This vibration manifests itself in the mind and, in turn, in the body as 
activities like thinking, speaking, moving etc. In other words it activates the mind and 
the body. 
This combination of soul with mind, body and speech is called YOGA. This 
yoga is active from the first to the thirteenth level of spiritual practices or purity of 
soul known as Gunasthana. At the highest or the fourteenth level it is finally absent. 
At the twelfth level although complete detachment is attained, Kewal-jnana is not 
acquired. At the thirteenth level Kewal-jnana is acquired and yoga is still existent; 
that is why it is known as sayogi Kewal-jnana. At the fourteenth level yoga becomes 
absent and so it is known as ayogi Kewal-jnana. 
These two also have two divisions. At the first (pratham) samaya of entry into 
the thirteenth level Kewal-jnana is acquired; this is called pratham samaya sayogi 
Kewal-jnana. After this it is called apratham samaya sayogi Kewal-jnana. Similarly 
that which has reached the final (charam) samaya of the thirteenth level is called 
charam samaya sayogi Kewal-jnana. Prior to that it is called acharam samaya sayogi 
Kewal-jnana. 
In the same way, Kewal-jnana acquired at the first (pratham) samaya of entry 
into the fourteenth level is called pratharn samayaayogi Kewal-jnana. After this it is 
called apratham samaya ayogi Kewal-jnana. That which has reached the final 
(charam) samaya of the fourteenth level is called charam samaya ayogi Kewal-
jnana. Prior to that it is called acharam samaya ayogi Kewal-inana. The maximum 
staying time at the fourteenth level is equivalent to the time lapsed in pronouncing 
five short vowels of Prakrit Sanskrit language (a, i, u, ri, lri). This state is also known 
as shaileshi (mountain like) state. As soon as this ends the Siddha state and 
dimension is attained. 
SIDDHA KEWAL-JNANA 
[086] MEANING -Question - What is this Siddha Kewal-jnana? 
Answer - Siddha Kewal-jnana is said to be of two types - Anantar-Siddha 
Kewal-jnana and Parampar-Siddha Kewal-jnana.

COMMENTARY -At the end of the shaileshi state the soul is finallyfree from 
the taijas (the radiant component of the constitution of abeing) and Karman (the 
karmic component of the constitution of abeing) bodies. 
This state is known as moksha or liberation or Siddhandimension, after 
shedding all the eight categories of karmas, suchliberated souls, by virtue of their 
being devoid of karmas, arecompletely free of this world or the cycles of rebirth. By 
class they areone or alike, and in number they are infinite. 
The quality of Kewal-jnana and the status of all Siddhas are same and 
unchanging.However, in order to make the concept comprehensible to commonman 
it has been divided in some categories with reference to parameters like time, place, 
mode etc. 
In order to vivify the form of Siddha with reference to worthiness, time, place 
and other such parameters commentator (vratt) Acharya Malayagiri has explained 
the two categories of Siddha, based on thetime of transcending, with the help of 
eight dears (ports). These two categories are– 
Anantar-Siddha or those who have transcended just one samaya back; and 
Parampar-Siddha or those who have transcended more than one samaya back. 
The eight dears (ports; here it means the parameters defining the passage 
into the state) are-1. Astik dwar or satpad-prarupana (theparameter of right faith), 
2.Dravya dwar or dravyapraman (theparameter of matter), 3.Kshetra dwar (the 
parameter of area), 4. Sparsha dwar (the parameter of contact), 
5. Kaal dwar (theparameter of time), 6. Antar dwar (the parameter of gap or 
void), 7.Bhava dear (the parameter of mode), and 8.Alpabahutva dear (the 
parameter of less and more). 
In order to fully understand these eight primary parameters each one of them 
is further divided into 15 secondary parameters-1. Kshetra, 2.Kaal, 3.Gati, 4.Ved, 
5.Teerth, 6.Ling, 7. Charttra, Buddha, 9. Jnana, 10.Avagahana, 11.Utkrisht, 
12.Antar, 13.Anusamaya, 14.Samkhya,and 15. Alpabahutva. 
1. ASTIK DWAR OR SATPAD PRARUPANA (THE PARAMETEROF RIGHT 
FAITH) 
In absence of the belief in the existence of Siddha the journey onthe spiritual 
path does not even begin. Therefore, the recognition ofthe status of Siddha is the 
first primary parameter. 
The fifteensecondary parameters to help understand this are as follows- 
1. Kshetra dwar (the parameter of area) - Beings living in the 15 karmabhumi 
(lands of activity) of adhai-dveep (two and a halfcontinents) attain the Siddha status. 
In context of transmigration, beings transmigrated from two oceans, lands of 
inactivity, antardveep (the middle continents), Panduk forest in the higher direction 
and Adhogamini Vijaya in the lower direction also become Siddha. 
2. Kaal dwar (the parameter of time) - The status of Siddha can be attained 
during the period starting from last part of the third epoch of a regressive cycle of 
time, covering the fourth epoch and going up to 64 years in the fifth epoch. During a 
progressive cycle of time this status can be attained during the third epoch and a 
small part of the fourth epoch. 
3. Gati dwar (the parameter of incarnation-dimension or the state of 
existence) - The status of Siddha can be attained only from the human dimension 
and no other. That too only those who are born after transmigrating from the first four 
Hells; the dimensions of earth-bodied, water-bodied and gross plant-bodied beings,

animals having five sense organs and human beings; and Bhavanpati, Van-vyantar, 
Jyotishk and Vaimanik classes of gods. 
4. Ved dwar (the parameter of gender) - In context of the present, only those 
beings who have transcended gender can attain the status of Siddha irrespective of 
originally belonging to masculine, feminine or neutral gender. 
5. Teerth dwar (the parameter of influence of Tirthankar) - By and large the 
status of Siddha is attained only during the period of influence of a Tirthankar. It is 
very rare that someone attains this status otherwise. 
6. Ling dwar (the parameter of religious status) - Physically speaking the 
status of Siddha can be attained by persons of all the three appearances - Svalingi 
(our own or dressed as shraman), Anyaltngt (other or in the dress of any other 
religious school), and Grihalingi (laity or dressed as a householder). However, 
spiritually speaking only those who are shramans can become Stddhas not others. 
7. Charitradwar (the parameter of level of purity) - There are five levels of 
purity leading to the Siddha status. Of these the primarily essential one is samayik 
charitra and compulsorily essential one is yathakhyat charitra (the level of absolute 
purity) in absence of whichit is not possible to become a Siddha. 
The status of Stddha is attained by a combination of these and any one or 
more of the remaining three. Some attain it through the combination of Samayik and 
Sukshma-samparaya, others through Samayik, Chhedopasthapaniya, and Sukshma-
samparaya; and so on. 
8. Buddha dwar (the parameter of enlightenment) 
-The status of Siddha is 
attained from all the three types of enlightened states - Pratyek-buddha, Suayam-
budddha and Buddha-bodhit. 
9. Jnana dwar (the parameter of knowledge) - With reference to the specific 
moment the status of Siddha is attained only through Kewal-Jnana. However, with 
reference to earlier period it is attained by acquiring Kewal-jnana through various 
combinations of matt, shrut, avadhi and manah-paryav-jnana. 
10. Avagahana dwar (the parameter of physical dimension) - The area 
occupied by a thing in space is called avagahana. The status of Stddha is attained 
by beings measuring a minimum of 2 arm-lengths, an average of seven arm-lengths 
and a maximum of 500 dhanush. 
11. Utkrtsht dwar (the parameter of upper limit) - - With reference to time the 
status of Siddha is attained after a lapse of Ardh-pudgal paravartankaal (a very large 
measure of time), infinite time, uncountable time, or countable time from the moment 
of acquiring samyaktva (a specific state of righteousness where right perception and 
right knowledge start translating into right conduct). 
12. Antar dwar (the parameter of gap) - The minimum gap of time between 
two beings attaining the Stddha status is one samaya. The maximum gap is six 
months once six months have passed without any being becoming a Stddha some 
being has to attain that status. 
13. Anusamaya dwar (the parameter of continuity) - For a minimum of two 
samayas and a maximum of eight samayas beings become Siddha one after another 
in continuity. After eight samayas there is a gap. 
14. Samkhya dwar (the parameter of number) - In one samaya a minimum of 
one and maximum of 108 beings can become Siddha; never more than that.

15. Alpabahutua dwar (the parameter of high and low) - The number of 
beings becoming Siddha two or three or four or more at a time is very low. The 
number of those becoming Siddha only one at a time is many times more. 
2. DRAVYA DWAR OR DRAVYAPRAMAN (THE PARAMETER OF 
MATTER) 
1. Kshetra dwar (the parameter of area) - With reference to transmigration in 
the upward direction, four beings become Stddhain one samaya. The number of 
beings becoming Siddha from different areas is - Four from the peaks of Nishadh 
Mountain, Nandan forest and Meru and other mountains; three from rivers and 
streams; two from oceans and Pandak forest; and 10 each from thirty lands of 
inactivity. From every vijaya a minimum of 20 and a maximum of 108. In one samaya 
a maximum of 108 beings can attain the status of Siddha from the fifteen lands of 
activity. 
2. Kaal dwar (the parameter of time)-An one samaya a maximum of 108 
beings can attain the status of Siddha during the third and the fourth epochs and 
twenty during the fifth epoch of a regressive cycle of time. The same rule applies to 
the third and fourth epochs in progressive cycle of time. During the remaining seven 
epochs, in one samaya ten beings each can become Siddha with reference to 
transmigration. 
3. Gatidwar (the parameter of incarnation-dimension or state of existence) - 
In one samaya 10 beings transmigrating from the Ratnaprabha, Sharkaraprabha and 
Balukaprabha Hells can become Siddha. This number is 4 for Pankprabha Hell, 10 
for normal animals, 4 each for particular earth-bodied and water-bodied beings and 6 
for plant-bodied beings. 
Beings transmigrating from states of underdeveloped and non-sentient beings 
with five sense organs cannot become Siddha. However, the above said number is 
20 for human beings, 10 for men and ten for women, 108 for the dimension of gods, 
ten each for Bhavanpati and Vyantar gods and five each for their goddesses, ten for 
Jyotishk gods and 20 for their goddesses, and 108 for Vaimanik gods and twenty for 
their goddesses. 
4. Ved dwar (the parameter of gender) - In one samaya 20 females, 108 
males and 10 neuters can become Siddha. In context of gender there are nine 
categories of beings transmigrated from the human dimension. Out of these, from 
the category of those who die as male and reincarnate as male 108 can become 
Siddha in one samaya. This number for the remaining eight categories is 10 each 
only. 
5. Teerth dwar (the parameter of influence of nrthankar) - In one samaya four 
male Tirthankars can become Siddha. The number is 2 in case of female 
Tirthankars. 
6. Ling dwar (the parameter of religious status) - In one samaya four 
Grihalingi can become Stddha. The number is 10 for Anyalingt and 108 for Svalingi. 
7. Charitra dwar (the parameter of level of purity) - In one samaya 108 each 
of 
those 
who 
perfect 
different 
required 
combinations 
of 
Samayik, 
Chhedopasthapniya and Sukshma-samparaya with yathakhyat charitra can become 
Siddha. The number is only 10 for those who perfect all the five charitras. 
8. Buddha dwar (the parameter of enlightenment) - In one samaya 10 
Pratyek-buddha can become Stddha. The number is 4 for Svayam-budddha and 108 
for Buddha-bodhit.

9 Jnana dwar (the parameter of knowledge) - In one samaya a maximum of 
four of those who possessed mati and shrut-jnana during their earlier incarnation can 
acquire Kewal-jnana and become Siddha. The number is 10 for those who 
possessed mati, shrut and manah-paryau-jnana, and 108 for those who possessed 
all the fourjnana. 
10. Avagahana dwar (the parameter of physical dimension) - In one samaya 
a maximum of four of those who have minimum physical dimension become Siddha. 
The number is 108 for medium physical dimension and 2 for maximum physical 
dimension. 
11. Utkrusht dwar (the parameter of upper limit) - In one samaya a maximum 
of 108 of those who have fallen from samyaktva for infinite period, if regain 
samyaktva, can become Siddha. The number is 10 each for those who have fallen 
for uncountable period and countable period. This number is four for those who do 
not fall or Apratipati samyaktva. 
12. Antar dwar (the parameter of gap) - The status of Siddha can be attained 
by some or the other being after gaps of 1, 2, 3 or more samaya. 
13. Anusamaya dwar (the parameter of continuity) - If beings attain the 
status of Siddha continuously for eight samayas a minimum of one and maximum of 
32 beings can become Siddha. This continuity essentially breaks in the ninth samaya 
or in otherwords in the ninth samaya no being becomes Siddha. In case the number 
of beings becoming Stddhli in one samaya is 33 to 48 this break occurs after 7 
samaya in the eighth samaya. This series goes as follows- 
49 to 60 beings becoming Siddha - the break is in the seventh samaya. 
61 to 72 beings becoming Siddha - the break is in the seventh samaya. 
73 to 84 beings becoming Siddha - the break is in the seventh samaya. 
85 to 96 beings becoming Siddha - the break is in the seventh samaya. 
97 to 102 beings becoming Stddha - the break is in the seventh samaya. 
103 to 108 beings becoming Siddha - the break is in the seventh samaya. 
14. Samkhya dwar (the parameter of number) - In one samaya a minimum of 
1 and a maximum of 108 beings become Siddha. 
15. Alpabahutva dwar (the parameter of high and low) - Same as mentioned 
earlier. 
3. KSHETRA DWAR (THE PARAMETER OF AREA) 
The area called Manushottar Parvat includes Adhai Dveep, Lavan Samudra 
and rialodadhi Samudra. To become Siddha one has to be born in this area only. 
This is the area of Kewal-jnana; outside this area, in absence of the same, attaining 
the status of Siddha is not possible. This parameter also has 15 sub-parameters 
which can be defined as before. 
4. SPARSHA DWAR (THE PARAMETER OF CONTACT) 
In the Siddha state the stainless soul-bits of Siddhas mutually coalesce. The 
soul-bits of all the Siddhas of past, present, and future, merge into one. Where there 
are infinite there is one and where there is one there are infinite. In earthly terms, as 
the rays of light from thousands of lamps merge into a beam, so do the Siddha souls, 
with their independent identity intact, combine in to one? This parameter also has 15 
sub-parameters which can be defined as before. 
5. KAAL DWAR (THE PARAMETER OF TIME) 
In the areas where 108 beings can become Siddha in one samaya, the 
continuity of the process is for eight samayas. In other words every samaya some 
 
NandiSootra 
 
Aagam- 44 -NandiSootra 
~ 48 ~ 
Compiled by- Deepratnasagar 
 
beings become Siddha for 8 samayas without a break. In case of the areas where 10 
to 20 beings can become Siddha this figure is 4 samayas and in case of the areas 
where 2 to 4 beings can become Siddha this figure is 2 samayas. This parameter 
has only 11 sub-parameters. They are as follows- 
1.Kshetra dwar (the parameter of area) - In the fifteen lands of activity a 
maximum of 108 beings can become Siddha in one samaya, therefore, there every 
samaya some beings become Siddha continuously for 8 samayas. In case of the 
lands of inactivity and the lower dimension this figure is 4 samayas. In case of 
Nandan and Panduk forests and Lavan Samudra this figure is 2 samayas. And in 
case of the higher dimension this figure is 4 samayas. 
2. Kaaldwar (the parameter of time) - Dunng the third and fourth epochs of 
the progressive and regressive cycles of time every samaya some beings become 
Siddha continuously for 8 samayas. In case of the remaining epochs this figure is 4 
samayas. 
3. Gatidwar (the parameter of incarnation-dimension) - Of the beings coming 
from the dimension of gods every samaya some beings become Siddha continuously 
for a maximum of 8 samayas. In case of the beings coming from remaining 3 
dimensions this figure is 4 samayas. 
4. Veddwar (the parameter of gender) - Of beings who were male in the 
earlier existence and have reborn as males in this existence, every samaya some 
beings become Siddha continuously for a maximum of 8 samayas. In case of the 
remaining this figure is 4 samayas. 
5. Teerthdwar (the parameter of influence of Tirthankar) - During the period 
of influence of a Tirthankar every samaya some beings become Siddha continuously 
for a maximum of 8 samayas. Male and female Tirthankars can become Siddha 
continuously for a maximum of 2 samayas. 
6. Ling dwar (the parameter of religious status) - Out of the Svalingis every 
samaya some beings become Siddha continuously for a maximum of 8 samayas. In 
case of the Anyalingis and Grihaltngis this figure is 4 and 2 samayas respectively. 
7. Charitra dwar (the parameter of level of purity) - Of those disciplined souls 
who have gradually observed all the five charitras every samaya some beings 
become Siddha continuously for a maximum of 4 samayas. In case of the remaining, 
or those who have observed 3 or 4 charttras this figure is 8 samayas. 
8. Buddha dwar (the parameter of enlightenment) - Of those who have been 
enlightened by an enlightened one every samaya some beings become Siddha 
continuously for a maximum of 8 samayas. In case of the self-enlightened this figure 
is 2 samayas. In case of those indoctrinated by ordinary ascetics this figure is 4 
samayas. 
9. Jnana dwar (the parameter of knowledge) - Of those who have become 
omniscient after acquiring matt and shrut-jnana every samaya some beings become 
Siddha continuously for a maximum of 2 samayas. In case of those who have 
become omniscient after acquiring mati, shrut and manah-paryav-jnana this figure is 
4 samayas. In case of that who.Have become omniscient after acquiring mati, shrut 
and avadhi-jnana as well as all the four jnana this figure is 8 samayas. 
10. Avagahana dwar (the parameter of physical dimension) - Of those having 
maximum physical dimensions every samaya some beings become Siddha 
continuously for a maximum of 2 samayas. In case of those having medium and 
minimum physical dimensions this figure is 8 and 2 samayas respectively. 
 
NandiSootra

11. Utkrisht dwar (the parameter of upper limit) - Of the Apratipati samyaktvi 
beings every samaya some beings become Siddha continuously for a maximum of 2 
samayas. In case of those who have fallen for countable and uncountable period and 
those who have fallen for infinite period, having medium and minimum physical 
dimensions this figure is 4 and 8 samayas respectively. 
6. ANTAR DWAR (THE PARAMETER OF GAP OR VOID) 
The time during which no being attains the status of Siddha is called the antar 
kaal (intervening period or time gap). This is also known as period of separation or 
virah kaal. The fifteen secondary parameters to help understand this are as follows- 
Kshetra dwar (the parameter of area) - In the whole adhai dveep this virah 
kaal is minimum one samaya and maximum six months. In the Maha Videh areas of 
Jambu Dveep and Dhatki Khand the maximum time gap is 2 to 9 years and in 
Pushkarardh Dveep this is a little more than one year. 
Kaal dwar (the parameter of time) - In the 5 Bharat and 5 Airavat areas this 
time gap is a little less than 18 kota-koti sagaropam. The fourth, fifth and sixth 
epochs of the progressive cycle of time are 2, 3 and 4 kota-koti sagaropam long 
respectively. After that the first, second and third epochs of the regressive cycle of 
time are 4, 3 and 2 kota-koti sagaropam long respectively. All these make a total of 
18 kota-koti sagaropam. Of these, in the beginning of the fourth epoch of the 
progressive cycle of time the period of influence of the 24th Tirthankar of that cycle 
of time continues for a countable period of time before it terminates.During the last 
part of the third epoch of the following regressive cycle of time the first Tirthankar of 
that cycle is born. His period of influence continues for a hundred thousand purvas. 
That is why the time gap is said to be a little less than 18 kota-koti sagaropam. 
During this period of influence of a Tirthankar the status of Siddha can be attained. 
Once it is terminated no being born in that area can become Siddha. With reference 
to transmigration the maximum time gap is countable thousand years. 
Gati dwar (the parameter of incarnation-dimension or state of existence) - 
The maximum time gap between beings transmigrating from hells and becoming 
Siddha is prithaktva thousand years. In case of the beings transmigrating from the 
state of existence asanimals, this gap is prithaktva hundred years. In case of beings 
transmigrating from the state of gods, accepting those from tiryanch and Saudharm 
Ishan dimensions, this gap is a little more than a year. In case of the self enlightened 
human beings this gap is countable thousand years. In case of the beings 
transmigrating from the state of existence as earth-, water- and plant-bodied beings, 
gods of Saudharm Ishan dimension and the second hell this gap is one thousand 
years. The minimum time gap is one samaya. 
Ved dwar (the parameter of gender) - The maximum time gap between 
beings becoming Siddha after turning genderless from masculine is a little more than 
one year. In case of feminine and neuter this gap is countable thousand years. With 
reference to transmigration in case of masculine turning masculine and becoming 
Siddha this gap is a little more than one year; in case of all the remaining this gap is 
countable thousand years. 
Teerth dwar (the parameter of influence of Tirthankar - The maximum time 
gap between Tirthankars becoming Siddha is prithaktva thousand purvas. In case of 
female Tirthankars this gap is infinite time. In case of non-Tirthankars and Pratyek 
Buddhas this gap is a little more than a thousand years and countable thousand 
years respectively.

Ling dwar (the parameter of religious status) - The maximum time gap 
between Svalingis becoming Siddha is a little more than one year. And that for 
Anyalingis and Grihalingis is countable thousand years. 
Charitra dwar (the parameter of level of purity) - The maximum time gap 
between beings becoming Stddha after perfecting Samayik and Sukshma-sam, 
paraya with yathakhyat charttra, in context of the earlier existence, is a little more 
than one year. In case of the remaining two combinations it is a little more than 18 
kota-koti sagaropam. 
Buddha dwar (the parameter of enlightenment) - The maximum time gap 
between beings enlightened by the enlightened one, indoctrinated by others, and 
self-enlightened becoming Siddhas is a little more than one year, countable 
thousand years and two to nine thousand purvas respectively. 
Jnana dwar (the parameter of knowledge) - The maximum time gap between 
those who have become Omniscient after acquiring matt and shrut-jnana becoming 
Siddha is uncountable fraction of one Palyopam. In case of those who have become 
omniscient after acquiring mati, shrut and avadhi-jnana it is a little more than a year. 
In case of those who have become omniscient after acquiring all the four jnanas it is 
countable thousand years. 
Avagahana dwar (the parameter of physical dimension) - The maximum time 
gap between those with maximum physical dimension becoming Siddha is so large 
that it has been explained by a conceptual example - if a cube is made of 14 rajjulok 
its one line of unit space points will be 7 rajjus long. The time taken in emptying this 
line at the rate of one space point per samaya is said to be equivalent to the said 
gap. In case of those having medium physical dimension this gap is a little more than 
one year and for those having minimum physical dimension it is one samaya. 
Utkrusht dwar (the parameter of upper limit) - The maximum time gap 
between the Apratipati samyaktvi beings becoming Siddha is uncountable fraction of 
one sagaropam. In case of those who have fallen for uncountable and countable 
period it is countable thousand years and in case of those who have fallen for infinite 
period it is a little more than one year. 
Anusamaya dwar (the parameter of continuity) - Beings become Siddha 
continuously for 2 to 8 samaya. 
Samkhya dwar (the parameter of number) - The maximum time gap between 
a solitary being becoming Siddha and many becoming Siddha together is countable 
thousand years. 
Alpabahutva dwar (the parameter of high and low) - As mentioned earlier. 
7. BHAVA DWAR (THE PARAMETER OF MODE) 
There are six types of modes or attitudes - Audayik, Aupashamik, 
Kshayopashamtk, Kshayik, Parinamik and Sanntpatik. Beings become Siddha only 
through Kshayik attitude. This parameter also has 15 sub-parameters which can be 
defined as before. 
8. ALPABAHUTVA DWAR 
(THE PARAMETER OF MINIMUM-MAXIMUM) 
The minimum number of beings becoming Siddha is from the higher world. 
The number of those from the lands of inactivity is countable times more than these. 
The number of those belonging to the female gender and other such categories is 
also countable times more than the first category. The number of those belonging to 
different Vijayas is countable times more than that of the second category. And the 
 
NandiSootra 
 
Aagam- 44 -NandiSootra 
~ 51 ~ 
Compiled by- Deepratnasagar 
 
number of those belonging to these areas from where 108 beings become Siddha is 
again countable times more than the third category. 
PARAMPAR-SIDDHA KEWAL-JNANA 
According to these parameters and sub-parameters the number ofbeings who 
have become Siddha for more than one samaya is infinite. This means that from all 
the areas infinite beings have become Siddha. More details about this can be seen 
in the thokada (a style of Jain writing where lists are compiled) of Parampar-Siddha. 
ANANTAR-S1DDHA KEWAL-INANA 
[087] MEANING -Question - What is thisAnantar Siddha Kewal-jnana? 
Answer - Anantar Siddha-kewal Jnana is said to be offifteen types-1. Teerth 
Siddha, 2. Ateerth Siddh, 3. Tirthankar Siddha, 4. Atirthankar Siddha, 5. Svayam-
buddha Siddha, 6.Pratyek-buddha Siddha, 7.Buddha-bodhit Siddha, 8. Streeling 
Siddha, 9. Purushling Sidda, 10. Napunsakling Siddha, 11.Svaling Siddha, 
12.Anyaling Siddha, 13.Grihiling Siddha, 14.Ek Siddha, 15. Anek Siddha 
The Kewal-jnana of all these Siddhas is known as Anantar Siddha Kewal-
jnana. 
COMMENTARY -The souls that have just attained Kewal-jnana orin other 
words only one samaya have passed since they attainedKewal-jnana are called 
Anantar Siddha. Depending upon theremundane position during their final existence 
and how they acquired Kewal-jnana before becoming Siddha they have been divided 
into 15 
Categories which are as follows- 
1. Teerth Stddha - Those who become Siddha after theestablishment of the 
religious organisation (Dharm, a-teerth orchaturvidh sangh comprising of male and 
female ascetics and laity)and during the period of influence of a Tirthankar are called 
TeerthSiddha. 
2. Ateerth Stddha - Those who become Siddha before the establishment of 
the religious organisation or after it get terminatedare called Ateerth Siddha. 
Bhagavan Rishabhdev's mother Marudeviis one such example as she' became 
Siddha before the Teerth was established. From the period of influence of Bhagavan 
Suvidhinath to that of Bhagavan Shantinath, during the seven intervening periods the 
Teerth became extinct. During these intervening periods all the liberated Kewalis are 
also called Atirtha Siddha. 
3. Tirthankar Siddha - Those who become Siddha after attaining the status 
of Tirthankar are called Tirthankar Stddha. One such example is Bhagavan Mahavir. 
4. Atirthankar Siddha - Besides the Tirthankars all the other Siddhas are 
called Atirthankar Siddha. One such example is Ga.] Sukumal Muni. 
5. Svayam-buddha Siddha - Those who become free of passions with their 
own efforts by acquiring Jattsmaran-jnana and Avadht-inana without any outside 
help including that of religious discourses or preaching and consequently get 
enlightened are called Svayam-buddha or self-enlightened. When they become 
Siddha they are called Svayam-buddha Siddha. All Tirthankars are examples of this. 
6. Pratyek-buddha Siddha - Those who get enlightened after getting inspired 
by some outside factor but without any help in the form of religious discourse and 
consequently become Siddha are called Pratyek-buddha Stddha. Some examples 
are Karkandu andNami Raja. 
(See Illustration 13) 
7. Buddha-bodhit Siddha - Those who get enlightened with the help of a 
discourse or preaching of a Tirthankar, acharya or any other accomplished ascetic

and consequently become Siddha are called Buddha-bodhit Siddha. Some examples 
are Chandanbala, Jambu Kumarand Atimuktak Muni etc. 
8. Streeling Siddha - The term streeling indicates womanhood. This is of 
three types - the female body, the female psyche and the female garb. When a soul 
in a female body becoiies Siddha it is called Streeling Siddha. As female psyche 
indicates the passions and lust it is against detachment and so there is no scope of 
liberation. The female garb can be used to cover a male or an idol as well and as 
such it is irrelevant in this context. Some examples are Mrigavati Chandan Bala etc. 
9. Purushling Siddha - When a soul in a male body becomes Siddha it is 
called Purushling Siddha. 
10. Napunsakling Siddha - When a soul in neuter gender body becomes 
Siddha it is called Napunsakling Siddha. 
11. Svaling Siddha - Here the term ling indicates the social status (like dress 
etc.). Those who become Siddha after indulging in spiritual practices as a shrarnan 
(Jain ascetic) are called Svaling Siddha. 
12. Anyaling Siddha - In spite of belonging to other religious school, those 
who indulge in spiritual practices according to the tenets of the Jina and 
consequently become Siddha are calledAnyaling Siddha 
13. Gruhiling Siddha - Those who become Siddha after indulging in spiritual 
practices as householders are called Grihiling Siddha. One example is Marudevi 
Mata. 
14. Ek Siddha - Those who become Siddha one at a time are called Ek 
Siddha. 
15. Anek Siddha - Those who become Siddha with others at thesame time (2 
to 108 in number) are called Anek Siddha.

COMMENTARY -Acharyas have varying opinion about upayoga! (Indulgence) 
in Kewal-jnana and Kewal darshan According to the Jain philosophy upayoga is of 
twelve types - five jnana, three ajnana, and four darshan. The details of this are-
1.Mati-jnana, 2.Shrut-jnana, 3.Avadhi jnana, 4.Manah-paryay-jnana and 5.Kewal-
jnana;' 1.Mati-ajnana, 2.Shrut-ajnana and 3. Vibhang-jnana (perverted knowledge);

Aagam- 44 -NandiSootra

and 1.Chakthu darshan (visual perception), 2.Achakshu darshan (non-visual 
perception), 3. Avadhi darshan and 4. Kewal darshan. 
A stable engrossment in any one of these for some time is ,called upayoga 
(indulgence). Except Kewal-jnana and Kewal darshan the remaining ten upayogas 
belong to the Chhadmasth state (state of finite cognition). 
A Mithyadrishti (one who is in the state of false cognition) has six Types of 
upayogas - three ajnana and three darshan. A chhadmasth, samyagdrishti has 
seven types of upayogas - four jnana and three darshan. A chhadmasth has ten 
types of upayogas which are kshayopashamik and there is a reduction and addition 
as well as progress and decline in these. Ketval-jnana and Kewal darshan are 
Kshayik and complete; they are without any reduction and addition or Progress and 
decline. 
The upayoga of a chhadmasth is gradual. In other words in one samaya there 
is only one upayoga. All the acharyas are unanimous On this point. However, there 
are three different views about the Upayoga of a kewalt- 
1. In spite of having absolutely unveiled knowledge and perception; kewali 
has only one upayoga in one samaya. When there is jnanopayoga (indulgence in 
knowledge) there is no darshanopayoga (Indulgence in perception) and when there 
is darshanopayoga there is No jnanopayoga. This belief is known as Kram Bhava or 
Ekanter Upayogavad (the school of gradual or unitary indulgence). Jinabhadragani 
Kshamashraman was among the supporters of this school. 
2. The second belief is that like the light and heat of the sun Kewal-jnana and 
Kewal darshan also coexist. Both indulge in 
their, respective subjects 
simultaneously. The famous logician Acharya Siddhasen Divakar was among the 
supporters of this school. This belief is famous as Yugpad Upayogavad (The school 
of coexistant indulgence). 
3. The third belief is that of the Abhedavadis (the school of singularity). 
According to them Kewal manaand Kewal darshan are one. In other words they are 
the two faces of the same coin. When the medium of grasping some subject is 
knowledge or jnana the separate existence of perception or darshan becomes 
redundant. Also, only jnana is accepted as authentic and not darshan As the Kewali 
has direct and independent experience, his darshan is jnana, only. Acharya 
Vriddhavadi was among the supporters of this school. This belief is famous as 
Abhinna Upayogavad (the school of Unified Indulgence). 
Upadhyaya Yashovijayji has combined these three different beliefs on the 
basis of Nayas. He says that if we look it from Ripu Sutra naya the Ekantar 
Upayogavad is correct. From the Vyavahar naya Yugapad Upayogavad is correct 
and from Sangraha naya Abhed Upayogavad is correct. In fact, there are no grounds 
for a difference of opinion on this subject. As Kewal-jnana and Kewal darshan are 
beyond comprehension and logic all these views are nothing but variations in efforts 
of understanding these concepts. This subject has been discussed in details in 
Nandi Sutra Churni (a type of commentary) and its Tika (another type of 
commentary) by Malayagiri. 
CONCLUSION 
[090] MEANING -Kewal-jnana is the means of knowing all existing 
substances and their manifestations and transformations including Audayik and 
other modes (form, smell, taste etc.). It is endless, eternal and indestructible. Such 
Kewal-jnana is of onetype only,

✻INDIRECT KNOWLEDGE✻ 
VAGYOGA AND SHRUT (SPEECH AND VERBALISATION) 
[091] 
MEANING 
-After 
seeing 
and 
knowing 
all 
substances, 
TirthankarBhagavan propagates through his discourse all what is worthdescribing or 
which can be expressed through speech. This isi called vachan-yoga or dravya shrut 
(the combination of thought i and speech or the material manifestation of 
knowledge). All other shrut is insignificant. 
[092] MEANING -This concludes the description of Kewal-jnana and also No: 
indriya pratyaksh. 
COMMENTARY -Tirthankar Bhagavan with the help of his Kewal-jnana sees 
and knows infinite things and infinite modes but not all come within the scope of 
expression. Therefore he tells only what is expressible in words. According to the 
Jain philosophy the inspiring cause for a discourse by a Kewal-jnan6 is not his 
omniscience but vachan yoga which manifests due to fruition of the karma known as 
Bhasha Paryapti. This vagyoga is also called dravya-shrut and it becomes bhava-
shrut (the thought manifestation of knowledge) for those who listen. This alone is the 
Shrut-jnana organised or verbalised by the Ganadhars - this is Again or the canons. 
PAROKSH-JNANA 
[093] MEANING -Question - What is this Paroksh-Jnana? 
Answer - Paroksh-Jnana is said to be of two types - Abhinibodhik-jnana and 
shrut-jnana. 
Where there is Abhinibodhik-jnana there also is shrut-friana and where there 
is shrut jnana there also is Abhinibodhik-jnana. 
They both are interdependent or exist with each other. Even then the 
acharyas detail difference between them. That which understands the presented 
object with authentication is called Abhinibodhik-jnana or mati jnana. And that which 
is listened is shrut jnana. Shrut-jnana is acquired only with mati (intellect) but mati 
jnana cannot be acquired just with shruti (hearing). 
COMMENTARY -The knowledge acquired with the help of five sense organs 
and mind is known as paroksh-jnana or indirect knowledge. 0 Its first category is 
matt -jnana. Mati' is also used for a mana (ignorance) but Abhinibodhik, another 
name of mati, is only used for jnana. It is the knowledge that understands things, 
brought before, with the help of five sense organs and mind. Shrut-jnana is that 
which understands these things by hearing about them. 
These two cannot exist without each other but the first requirement is mati-
jnana. It is exactly same as for the existence of cloth, both warp and woof are 
necessary but still first the warp is stretched and then only woof can be woven. In 
other words mati jnana is the cause and shrut-jnana its effect. Information of the 
present is the subject of mati-jnana whereas the subjects of shrut-jnana are all the 
three facets of time. In one sensed to four sensed beings there is no dravya 
(physical) shrut but even they have bhava shrut (thought). 
TWO FORMS OF MATI AND SHRUT 
[094] MEANING -Generally speaking mati is of two types - mati-jnana 
andmati-ajnana. Specifically the mati of samyagdrishti is mati-jnana and that of 
mithyadrishti is mati-ajnana. 
In the same way, generally speaking shrut is of two types - shrut-jnana and 
shrut-ajnana. Specifically the shrut of samyagdrishti is shrut-jnana and that of Mithya 
 
NandiSootra 
 
Aagam- 44 -NandiSootra 
~ 55 ~ 
Compiled by- Deepratnasagar 
 
Drishti is shrut-ajnana. 
COMMENTARY -The attitudes and understanding of a mithyadrishti is 
perverted. Therefore the knowledge acquired by him is misused. He accepts truth as 
well as lie and turns truth into a lie. That is why the knowledge of a mithyadrishti is 
called ajnana whether it is mati or shrut. 
On the other hand, a samyagdrishti understands a thing with reference to its 
authenticity and view points and accordingly accepts truth and reality and rejects 
falsity and unreality. He churns falsity and extracts truth out of it and uses his 
knowledge only for the development of self and others. Therefore, it is only the 
knowledge of a samyagdrishti that is truly called jnana whether it is mati or shrut. 
The knowledge of samyagdrishti provides guidance to others on the spiritual 
path whereas the knowledge of mithyadrishti only inspires controversy, vituperation, 
argument etc. and causes spiritual regression. 
Here a doubt arises - when jnana and ajnana both are caused by 
Kshayopasham of the knowledge veiling karma why the division of right and false? 
The root cause of this is the fruition of mtthyatva mohaniya karma (the karma that 
prevents the true perception of reality and causes affinity for falsity) which turns truth 
into a lie and jnana into ajnana. 
✻ABHINIBODHIK-JNANA (MATI-JNANA) ✻ 
[095] MEANING -Question - What is this abhinibodhik-jnana? 
Answer - Abhibodhik-jnana (mati-jnana) is said to be of Two types - shrut 
nishrit and ashrut nishrit. 
Question - What is this ashrut nishrit? 
Answer - Ashrut nishrit is said to be of four types- 
[096] MEANING -1.Autpattiki, 2.Vainayiki, 3.Karmaja and 4.Parinamiki. It is 
said that wisdom is of these four types; a fifth type does not exist. 
COMMENTARY -Shrut nishrit means that which is acquired bylistening to the 
shrut. Ashrut nishrit is that which acquirednaturally without any help from the shrut is. 
The four 'types of ashrutnishrit are briefly defined as follows- 
Autpattiki - That which raises suddenly, spontaneously and without studying 
scriptures is called autpattiki buddhi. 
Vainayiki - That which is acquired through devotion for teachers and elders or 
seniors, by serving them and being humblebefore them is called vainayiki buddhi. 
Karmaja - That which is acquired through regular practice likethat of various 
arts and crafts. 
Parinamiki 
- 
That 
which 
is 
acquired 
through 
long 
andcontinuous 
contemplation or as a consequence of maturity andexperience is called parinamiki 
buddhi. 
ATTRIBUTES OF AUTPATTIKI BUDDHI 
[097] MEANING -The wisdom that helps understand at once the 
correctmeaning of and the information conveyed by hitherto unseenand unheard of 
things is called autpattiki buddhi.

COMMENTARIES [098 to 100] - In the Agams are found numerous stories 
about spontaneous wisdom and intelligence. In this verse are listed titles of some 
such stories given as examples of autpattiki buddhi. The topic can be easily and 
clearly understood with the help of these stories- 
1. Bharat - Near the city of Ujjaini there was a village of acrobats, where lived 
an acrobat named Bharat. Leaving a son behind, his wife had died. His name was 
Rohak. He was a prodigious and sharp witted child. To provide proper care to the 
infant and look after the household, Bharat married again. 
Bharat's new wife was a wicked woman and she tortured Rohak. Fed up with 
this treatment Rohak one day said - ""Mother! You ill-treat me, is it becoming of you?"" 
The step-mother got infuriated at these words and shouted - ""Rascal! So small and 
still a loud mouth. I will treat a rascal like you as I wish. Do what you like."" 
The words of his step-mother acted like a sting and Rohak resolved to take 
revenge. He waited for an opportune moment. One night when he was sleeping near 
his father, he suddenly got up and said - ""Father, look! Someone is running away."" A 
shadow of doubt crept into Bharat's mind that his wife was not true to him. Slowly he 
distanced from his wife and even stopped talking to her. 
Rohak's step-mother understood that all this was his doing. He had provoked 
his father against her she got her lesson. She spoke to Rohak affectionately - ""Son, I 
had committed a mistake. In future I will improve my behaviour and shower my love 
on you."" Rohak's childish anger was pacified and he looked for an opportunity to 
remove his father's doubt. One moonlit night he pointed at his own shadow and said 
- ""Father! Look someone is running away."" Bharat was filled with anger. He drew out 
his sword, took a step and asked - ""Where is that rogue?"" Rohak innocently pointed 
at his own shadow and said - ""Here."" 
When Bharat saw the shadow he realised his mistake. He repented on his 
behaviour and asked his wife's pardon. The couple resumed the normal marital 
behaviour. Intelligent Rohak thought - ""A step-mother is after all a step-mother. She 
may get angry at me due to some mistake of mine and may poison me some day to 
take revenge."" Therefore he spent all his time with his father. He ate with his father 
and slept with him as well. 
One day Bharat had to go to Ujjaini on some errand. Rohak also went with 
him. The little boy was enchanted with the beauty and grandeur of the city and 
roaming around the streets he memorised the plan of the city. When it was time to 
return home Bharat took Rohak with him and came out of the city. When they 
reached the banks of the nearby Kshipra River, Bharat remembered that he had 
forgotten something. He asked Rohak to sit down at the riverbank and returned to 
the city. 
Rohak started playing with the sand and started making a model of Ujjaini. 
Soon he made a complete scale model of the city including its palaces. 
Coincidentally the king passed that way. When he arrived where Rohak had made 
 
NandiSootra 
 
Aagam- 44 -NandiSootra 
~ 57 ~ 
Compiled by- Deepratnasagar 
 
the city in the sand and was about to step on the model Rohak stopped him - ""Sir ! 
Please don't step on this road."" 
Taken by surprise the king asked, ""Why? What is the matter son?” 
Rohak - ""Sir I This is the king's palace. Nobody is allowed to enter without the 
king's permission.""With curiosity the king carefully looked at the model made by 
Rohak. He wasastonished at what he saw, and thought - ""This little boy is highly 
intelligent. He has wandered around the city and made this scale model. I have 499 
ministers. If I have a sharp witted prime minister as their chief my kingdom will make 
tremendous progress. But first I should test him."" The king inquired about the boy's 
name and address and returned to the city. A little later Bharat came and left for his 
village with Rohak.The king did not forget this incident and made necessary 
arrangements for assessing Rohak's wisdom. 
2. The Rock - First of all the king summoned the villagers from Rohak's 
village and asked them to make such a pavilion that suits the king's grandeur and 
then cover it with the giant rock lying outside the village. But the condition is that the 
rock should not be dug out from that place. 
The acrobats returned to there village and were deeply worried - ""There is no 
problem in erecting a pavilion but how to place the rock over it without lifting it up."" 
While they were deliberating thus, Rohak arrived there to call his father for dinner. 
He heard the exchange between the elders and at once understood there problem. 
Looking at the elders he said - ""You are unnecessarily bothering yourselves with this 
small problem. I will free you of your worries just now."" 
The astonished chief asked boy Rohak about his solution. Rohak explained - 
""First of all you clear some land by digging out the sand around the rock then erect 
strong pillars under its edges all around. The pillars should be strong enough to take 
the weight of the rock. Now excavate out all the sand from under the rock and fill the 
gaps between the pillars with beautifully designed walls. The pavilion will be ready 
without removing the rock from where it rests."" 
The villagers were pleased. They constructed a beautiful pavilion following 
Rohak's instructions. When the job was completed theywent to the king' and with 
pride informed him that they had made a pavilion following the king's instructions. He 
could come and inspect it at his convenience. 
The king came and saw the pavilion and was much pleased. He asked - Who 
advised you how to make this pavilion?” 
The villagers uttered Rohak's name in one voice and acclaimed his wisdom 
and intelligence. The king expected this reply. He also praised Rohak and returned 
to plan another test. 
3.The Ram - For Rohak's second test the king sent a ram to the villagers with 
instructions that it should be kept in the village with all necessary care so that when it 
is returned it should neither have gained nor lost any weight. 
The villagers again got worried - If we give it rich food it will gain weight and if 
not it will loose."" When they failed to find a solution they called Rohak and asked his 
advice. Rohak at once provided a solution. Accordingly a tiger was caught and put in 
a cage. In front of the cage the ram was tethered to a tree and fed richly and in 
abundance. A fortnight later the ram was sent back to the king. When the king got 
the ram weighed he was surprised to see that there was no change in its weight. 
When he asked about the person who did the trick, he was pleased to know that this 
clever solution was also provided by Rohak.

4. The Cock - A few days later the king sent a cock to the villagers with a 
message that it does not fight. It should be trained to fight but without using another 
cock.This time also Rohak provided the solution when he saw the elders unable to 
find one. He arranged for a large and thick mirror and placed it before the cock. 
When the cock looked into the mirror it found another cock looking back at it. At first 
it was surprised but soon it started pecking at its own image. In a few days it became 
a fully trained fighting cock. The king was pleased to get the news. 
5.Sesame Seeds - When some days passed the king called the acrobats to 
his court and asked pointing at a large heap of sesame seeds - ""Without counting 
and taking much time tell me how mane seeds are there in this heap."" 
The acrobats were dumb struck. They at once sent a messenger to Rohak. 
He sent the messenger back with necessary instructions. On reaching the court the 
messenger said to the king - ""Sir, we have very little knowledge of arithmetic. The 
number of seeds in this heap is so large that it is beyond the numbers we know. 
However, we can convey it to you by using a metaphor. The total number of stars 
that can be seen in the patch of sky right above the city of Ujjaini is exactly equal to 
the number of seeds in this heap."" The king was once again impressed by Rohak's 
wisdom. 
6. Sand - The king started enjoying these tests he arranged for Rohak. This 
time he asked the acrobats - ""The sand of the dunes outside your village looks 
beautiful. Do one thing, make a long rope of that sand and bring it for me."" 
This time the acrobats were filled with fear for their life. This impossible task 
appeared to be even beyond Rohak's wisdom. However, they still went to Rohak for 
solution. Rohak was not just a simple minded intelligent person, he was clever as 
well. He at once gave them a solution. 
The chief of the acrobats went to the king and submitted in presence of all his 
courtiers - ""Sir! We are acrobats and can only perform acrobatics on bamboo and 
ropes. We do not know how to make ropes, but we know that ropes come in many 
designs. We are ready to follow your command in all earnestness but you will have 
to take a little trouble. Please arrange for a small piece of sample of a rope made of 
sand so that we may copy the design and make a similar rope for you."" 
The king was at a loss to find words in reply. He was all praises for Rohak's 
cleverness. 
7. The Elephant - After this the king one day sent an old elephant, who was 
about to die, to the village of acrobats. He also sent instructions that the villagers 
should take proper care of the elephant and report about its well being every day. 
The day anyone gave the news that the elephant had died all the villagers will be 
punished. 
Filled with fear the villagers once again came to Rohak. He listened 
everything and gave them assurance - ""You just regularly feed the elephant. I will 
take care of everything."" In the evening the elephant was given best suitable diet for 
it, but still it could not pass the night. The villagers became afraid. But Rohak came 
and gave them necessary instruction after reassuring them. 
The villagers went to the king and informed - ""Sir! The elephant is neither 
eating nor drinking anything,it is neither standing nor making any other movement. It 
appears that it is not even breathing."" The king, displaying a mock anger, uttered in 
high pitched voice - ""Has the elephant died?"" The acrobats humbly said - ""Your 
excellency, how can we say that, it is for you to decide.""

The king was once again astonished at the sharp intelligence of Rohak and 
remained silent. The villagers returned happy. 
8. The Well - Once again, finding an opportune moment, the king sent a 
message to the villagers - ""The water of the well in your village is very cool and 
sweet. Send that well to me otherwise you will be punished."" 
This impossible demand of the king once again terrorised the villagers. But 
they had the support of Rohak in solving such problems. He was asked the solution. 
After being tutored by Rohak /they went to the king and said - ""Sir- ! As per your 
instructions we went to our village-well and tried to persuade it to come to you in the 
city. But it is very shy and apprehensive; not only this, it is very sceptic as well. It is 
not even ready to believe us that you have called it. We humbly submit that you 
should send some city-well to our village to persuade that village-well. We are 
confident that thevillage-well will believe the statement of a kin and at once 
accompany it here."" The king silently smiled. He understood that all this was inspired 
by the astute wisdom of Rohak. 
Thus, with every test the king's attraction for Rohak increased and he also 
started enjoying these games of intellect. 
9. The Patch of Forest - After allowing a few days to pass the king sent 
another order - ""Shift the patch of forest on the east side of your village to the west 
side."" 
As ever, the villagers took refuge with Rohak. He said - ""This is a child's play. 
Ours is a tiny village. Let us collect all our possessions and shift the village itself to 
the east of the patch of forest. As a result the patch of forest will automatically be on 
the west of the village."" After establishing the new village the king was informed that 
his order has been complied with. The king came and inspected. He silently praised 
Rohak and returned. 
10. Kheer (a dessert cooked with rice and milk) - One day the king 
suddenly called the chief of the acrobats and said - ""Cook some Kheer without a fire 
and send it for me."" 
The acrobats once again sought Rohak's help. He said - ""First of all submerge 
some rice in water. After some time transfer them in a deep cooking vessel filled with 
milk. Make a heap of lime and place this covered vessel in a hollow made in this 
heap. Now sprinkle water over the lime. The heat produced by the exothermic 
reaction of water and lime will be enough to cook the rice."" 
The villagers followed the instructions given by Rohak and cooked Kheer. It 
was sent to the king, who became very pleased to eat the tasty dessert. When he 
heard about the process of cooking his attraction for Rohak's wisdom increased. 
11. Atig - The next time the king called Rohak himself and said - ""The boy 
who wishes to obey my order should come to me exactly following my instructions. 
While coming he should stick to these rules - he should neither come during the 
bright fortnight nor the dark one; he should neither come during the night nor the 
day; he should neither come in the sun nor the shade; he should neither comeby the 
aerial rout nor the land one; he should neither come on the path nor away from it; 
and he should neither come after taking a bath nor without taking one. But come he 
has to."" 
Hearing these impossible rules there was a pin drop silence in the assembly. 
Every one was thinking that, what to say of a child, it was impossible even for an 
experienced adult to observe these rules and come to the king. But Rohak was not 
 
NandiSootra 
 
Aagam- 44 -NandiSootra 
~ 60 ~ 
Compiled by- Deepratnasagar 
 
flustered at all. He returned to his village in his usual composed manner, just before 
the end of the next dark fortnight he washed his body up to his neck and at the hour 
of the dusk prepared to leave. He made an umbrella of a perforated metal vessel 
and sat on the back of a ram. He set out to meet the king on the passage in the 
middle of the lines made by two wheels of the carts plying on the road. He picked up 
a lump of sand for presenting to the king. 
When he arrived before the king he properly greeted the king and explained 
him how he had observed the rules laid down by the king while coming to him. After 
that he offered the lump of sand as a gift to the king. The king asked with surprise - 
""What is this?” 
Rohak said humbly - ""Sir! You are the lord of the land; therefore I have 
brought a piece of land as gift for you."" 
The king was pleased and he asked Rohak to live with him. The happy 
villagers returned. During the night the king asked Rohak to sleep near him. During 
the second quarter of the night the king awoke and asked Rohak - ""Are you awake or 
asleep, Rohak?” 
He at once replied - ""I am awake, Sir!” 
""What are you thinking about?” 
""I am thinking how the dung-balls are made in a goat's stomach?” 
The king found no reply to Rohak's question. He asked Rohak - ""Did you find 
an answer? How are they made?” 
""Sir, in the stomach of a goat there is a unique type of wind called samvartak. 
The effect of this wind makes its excreta into balls."" And Rohak went to sleep. 
12. Leaves - During the third quarter of the night the king once again called - 
""Rohak, are you awake?” 
""Yes, I am awake, Sir!” 
""What are you thinking about?” 
""In Peepal leave which is large, stalk or the pointed edge?” 
The king became confused. He asked Rohak -, -""What did you decide?"" 
""As long as a part of the edge does not dry, both are equal."" After giving this 
reply Rohak went back to sleep. 
13. The Squirrel - During the fourth quarter of the night the king once again 
called - -""Rohak, What are you thinking about?” 
""Sir, the tail of a squirrel is larger than its body or smaller?” 
""What do you think?” 
""Sir, both are equal."" 
14. Five Fathers - The night ended. At dawn the sound of auspicious music 
woke the king but Rohak was still in deep sleep. He did not awake even when the 
king called. The king then goaded him with’ his stick. When Rohak opened his eyes 
the king asked - ""Say Rohak! What are you thinking now?” 
""Sir, I was thinking how many fathers you have?” 
This loose statement first infuriated the king. But as he had faith in Rohak's 
wisdom he composed himself and asked - ""You tell me, how many fathers I have?” 
Rohak became serious and said - ""Sir! You have five fathers."" The king 
uttered with surprise - ""What? Tell me how?” 
Rohak replied - ""First is Kuber (the god of wealth) because you are as 
magnanimous as Kuber. The second is chandal (the keeper of a crematorium) 
because for your enemies you are as cruel as a chandal. The third is washer-man 
 
NandiSootra 
 
Aagam- 44 -NandiSootra 
~ 61 ~ 
Compiled by- Deepratnasagar 
 
because as a washer-man squeezes all water from the clothes so you do squeeze 
everything out of a traitor of the kingdom or the country. The fourth is a scorpion 
because just as a scorpion causes pain by its sting, you have caused pain to me by 
goading with a stick. And your fifth father is your real father, the late king, because 
like him you are benevolently and justly ruling over your subjects and the kingdom."" 
The king was astonished at this analysis. After daily chores he went to his 
mother and after greetings told her about all what Rohak had said. The queen 
mother said - ""Son! What Rohak says is probably true. If your attitudes are the result 
of my looking at something with some momentary perversions in my mind then what 
Rohak says is true. When you were in my womb I went to the Kuber temple for 
worship. On my way back I saw a chandal and a washer-man. When arrived at the 
palace I saw a scorpion couple mating. During all this period my mind was in a state 
of perversion giving rise to pervert feelings. These feelings have influenced your 
attitude. Otherwise you have only one father."" 
The king was completely taken aback by the miracles of the astonishing 
wisdom of Rohak. When he arrived in his assembly he appointed Rohak as his prime 
minister. 
EXAMPLES OF THE SECOND VERSE 
1. The stories of Bharat and the Rock are same as before. 
2. The Condition - Once an innocent and simple farmer from a village went to 
a city to sell cucumbers. As he reached the city gate he met a rogue who at once 
measured him to be a simpleton and a prey. The rogue approached the farmer and 
said - ""Brother, if I eat all your cucumbers what would you offer me as a prize?"" The 
farmer looked at him with surprise. To him the statement about eating the large heap 
of cucumbers appeared to be a joke He also replied in the same spirit - ""If you eat all 
these cucumbers I will give a laddu (ball shaped sweet) that does not come through 
this gate."" They had this wager and some of the onlookers became witnesses. 
The rogue now picked up one cucumber, bit and ate a small piece from it and 
put the cucumber back. After that he lifted another cucumber and repeated the 
process. This way he ate a small piece from each cucumber and said to the farmer - 
""Here brother, I have eaten all your cucumbers."" 
Taken unawares the farmer said with anger - ""Where have you eaten all the 
cucumbers? They are all lying here."" 
The rogue said - ""I will prove in no time that I have eaten all the cucumbers."" 
Hewent and stood near the heap of cucumbers and started trying to sell them. He 
shouted and called many people and asked them to buy the cucumbers. Everyone 
who came and looked at the cucumbers refused to buy them saying - ""All these 
cucumbers are eaten."" 
The rogue said to the farmer - ""See, everyone says these cucumbers are 
eaten. You have lost the wager. Now give me the laddu."" The witnesses also failed 
to counter this argument.The farmer was disturbed. He could not think what to do. 
He tried ii to pay some money and get rid of the rogue but it was not so easy to 
convince him. At last the farmer sought some time on the pretext that he will have to 
search and bring the laddu. 
Now he went into the city and looked for someone who could save him from 
this predicament. When he walked some distance he found another rogue who was 
good enough to show him a way out.

The farmer was pleased. He at once went to a shop and purchased a laddu. 
Coming back to the place where the rogue was waiting with the witnesses, he placed 
the laddu outside the city gate. He himself walked and stood on the other side of the 
gate. Now he gestured with his hand beckoned the laddu - ""0 laddu! Come on! Enter 
this gate."" 
After repeatedly shouting and gesturing for some time when the laddu did not 
move from where it was placed, the farmer approached the rogue and said - ""Here is 
your laddu brother. I told you that I will give a laddu that does not come through this 
gate. This is one such obstinate laddu. Now I have fulfilled my commitment."" The 
rogue was stunned. The witnesses also accepted the farmer's argument. 
3. The Tree - Some wayfarers stopped under a dense mango tree to rest. 
When they looked up they saw that it was loaded with ripe mangoes and some 
monkeys were leaping around playfully. The ripe mangoes made their mouths water. 
The height of the tree and the fear of monkeys were the impediments that made 
them stop and think. Each one of them started applying his brain. Suddenly one of 
them had a brain wave. He picked up a few stones and one by one started throwing 
them at the monkeys. As the monkeys are hyperactive and born mimics they started 
mimicking the action of throwing stones by plucking mangoes and throwing them at 
the wayfarers. The travellers had their fill and resumed their journey. 
4. The Finger-ring - The city of Rajagriha was once under the rule of king 
Prasenjit. He had won over his enemies with his courage and valour. He had also 
won over the hearts of the masses with his love for justice. He had a number of sons 
but one of them, Shrenik, was his favourite. Prince Shrenik was endowed with an 
attractive personality, astonishing wisdom, and all other princely virtues. Due to the 
apprehension that his son could be murdered out of jealousy the king refrained from 
expressing his affection for Shrenik. This was a source of pain for Shrenik's young 
heart. Distressed by the absence of due affection and honour from his father's side, 
one day Shrenik decided to abscond from the palace. Making necessary plan he one 
day eloped from the palace to go on a journey to far away lands. 
While on his journey he reached one day a city named Vennatat and sat down 
at the shop of a merchant to take rest. Due to bad luck this merchant had lost all his 
wealth and grandeur and was somehow passing this lean period. It appeared as if 
this coincidence of Shrenik's sitting at his shop turned the tide of his fate. Soon his 
old stocks were selling at high prices and at the same time he was able to close a 
deal of purchasing high priced gems from foreign merchants at a bargain price. This 
unusual incident made him think - ""I have made unprecedented profits today. It 
appears that the presence of this scintillating young man has certainly played a 
fateful role. He is, for sure, some great and pious soul."" 
He also recalled the dream he had seen last night. He had dreamt that his 
daughter was getting married to a Ratnakar (source of gems, a sea). The merchant 
thought - ""He who imparts so much of profit just by his presence should be a 
Ratnakar."" Curiosity guided him to ask Shrenik - ""Whose guest are you in this town?"" 
Shrenik replied humbly and softly - ""Sir, I am your guest only."" The expression of this 
affinity won the heart of the merchant. He affectionately took Shrenik to his 
residence. 
Offering him rich food with due honour, the merchant requested him to stay at 
his residence. Thinking that, after all, he will have to find some place to stay, Shrenik 
accepted the invitation. As luck would have it, the merchant's prosperity and prestige

multiplied with every passing day. Very soon he recovered all his lost wealth as well 
as good will. He considered all this to be the influence of Shrenik's spiritual merit. A 
few days later he married his virtuous and beautiful daughter, Nanda, to Shrenik. 
And now Shrenik lived a happy and comfortable married life at his father-in-laws 
house. In due course Nanda became pregnant. 
Back at Rajagriha, king Prasenjit was in a state of gloom since Shrenik had 
eloped. He sent his spies all around in search of Shrenik. After a long search some 
of the spies informed about Shrenik's presence in Vennatat city. The king sent a 
contingent of soldiers to bring back Shrenik. When these soldiers informed Shrenik 
that his father misses him acutely and wants him to return, he decided to return 
immediately. In a letter he wrote all pertinent details about himself to Nanda and 
begging her leave, left for Rajagriha. 
A divine soul had descended into the womb of Nanda. Under the pious 
influence of this soul Nanda had a dohad (pregnancy desire) that she should ride an 
elephant and go around the city offering wealth and goodwill to the townspeople. 
Nanda's father was pleased to fulfil her desire. In due course Nanda gave birth to a 
beautiful, playful and healthy son. The birth ceremony of this brilliant child was 
celebrated and he was named Abhaya Kumar. 
With passage of time Abhaya Kumar started growing and getting education. 
He soon acquired profound knowledge of numerous scriptures and many arts, crafts 
and skills. Young Abhaya Kumar one day asked his mother - ""Ma! Who is my father 
and where does he live?"" Considering that it was proper time for Abhaya Kumar to 
know everything, she gave him Shrenik's letter and told him her complete story. 
Abhaya Kumar was pleased to know about his father and became eager to go to 
Rajagriha. When he sought permission from his mother, she also decided to join 
him. After necessary preparations both, mother and son, left for Rajagriha with a 
merchant convoy. 
After a few days of travel the convoy reached Rajagriha. They camped in a 
beautiful garden outside the city. Abhaya Kumar left his mother in care of the group 
and went into the city. He wanted to acquaint himself with the city atmosphere and 
explore how to approach the king gracefully. 
After covering some distance within the city he saw a crowd of people 
gathered at a place. Curiosity drew Abhaya Kumar to that spot and he found that the 
crowd had gathered around a dry well. When he asked about the cause he was told 
that a gold ring belonging to the king had fallen in the well and the king had 
announced a reward for the person who can get it out of the well without getting 
down into the well. The crowd was of the people wanting to find a way to bring out 
the ring but no one could find one till that moment. 
Abhaya Kumar said - ""If I get the permission I can bring the ring out."" The 
man standing adjacent to him at once gave this information to the state employees. 
Realising that some intelligent individual has come, the king's men requested 
Abhaya Kumar to get the ring out. 
Abhaya Kumar picked up a handful of cow-dung lying nearby and carefully 
dropped it on the ring visible in the well. A few hours later when the lump of cow-
dung in the well dried, he filled the well with water with the help of the king's men. As 
the water level rose to the brim of the well the dung-lump floated on the surface. 
Abhaya Kumar leaned and lifted the dung-heap. He broke the lump and released the 
ring. After washing it well he handed over the ring to the king's men. When the king 
 
NandiSootra 
 
Aagam- 44 -NandiSootra

Compiled by- Deepratnasagar 
 
heard this news he was astonished. He at once sent his emissary to bring Abhaya 
Kumar and when he came the king warmly greeted him and asked - ""Son! Who are 
you and where from do you come?” 
With due respect Abhaya Kumar replied - ""Lord! I am your son."" King Shrenik 
was taken aback at this answer from Abhaya Kumar. When he looked at wide eyed 
Shrenik, his father, he narrated in details the story of his life from his birth to his 
arriving at Rajagriha. King Shrenik was exhilarated with joy. He got up from his 
throne and embraced his able son. After this the father and the son brought queen 
Nanda into the palace with due celebrations and pomp and show. On the way the 
citizens of Rajagriha extended an unprecedented welcome to the royal family. 
Impressed by Abhaya Kumar's autpattiki buddhi, very soon the king honoured him 
with the post of prime minister. 
5. The Cloth - Two wayfarers coincidentally reached a lake at the same time. 
One of them, who appeared wealthy, was wearing costly dress and had a very costly 
woollen shawl on his shoulders. The other was dressed in ordinary clothes and had 
a rough cotton shawl on his shoulders. At the bank of the lake they both put off their 
clothes and started bathing. The man with ordinary dress quickly finished his bath, 
put on his dress, picked up the costly woollen shawl and left hastily. The wealthy 
man called when he saw this - ""Hey! Where are you taking my shawl?"" The swindler 
did not respond and continued to walk slowly. The wealthy person rushed after 
getting dressed and caught the swindler. But the swindler started a dispute by 
claiming the shawl to be his. At last they went to the court and requested the judge to 
pass a judgement after telling him about their respective claims. 
At first the judge failed to arrive at some conclusion. There was no identifying 
mark on the shawl that could point at its owner. After pondering over the matter for 
some time the judge called for two fresh combs. He asked the two claimants to comb 
their hair well and return the combs. He then carefully examined the two combs. He 
found that the comb of the wealthy person had some fibres of wool and that of the 
cunning had cotton fibres. The secret of the shawl was revealed. The judge gave the 
shawl to its rightful owner and got the cunning person apprehended and punished. 
6. The Chameleon - Once a man was passing through a jungle when he 
suddenly wanted to defecate. In hurry he found a hole in the ground and sat over it 
to relieve himself. This was not a simple hole but a chameleon's burrow. While the 
man was defecating the chameleon rushed and entered its burrow touching the 
man's anus. The defecating man felt as if the chameleon had entered his stomach 
through his anus. He kept worrying about it for some days and it turned into a 
phobia. He fell sick and in spite of all treatment did not recover. His weakness 
increased with every passing day. 
One day he went to a very experienced doctor. The doctor examined his 
pulse and conducted other tests as well but failed to find any medical cause of his 
weakness. At last the doctor asked him since when he was having this condition. 
The man told him the story of going to relieve himself in the jungle and a chameleon 
entering his anus. The doctor at once understood that it was a psychological ailment 
and with the help of his autpattiki buddhi he at once found the solution. 
However, he said to the patient - ""This is a serious disease. I will have to 
make a special medicine to expel the chameleon out of your stomach. Your 
treatment will be done tomorrow."" After the patient left, the doctor arranged for a 
dead chameleon, covered it with shellac and placed it in a bowl. He placed this bowl 
 
NandiSootra 
 
Aagam- 44 -NandiSootra 
~ 65 ~ 
Compiled by- Deepratnasagar 
 
outside his house in a dark corner. Next day he called the patient, gave him a strong 
purgative, and told him to pass his stool in that bowl. When the patient did as told, 
the doctor drew the bowl in light and pointing at the dead chameleon in the pot said - 
""See, this is the chameleon that has been causing you so much pain since long. Now 
it has been expelled and soon you will regain your health. The patient was relieved 
and pleased. As he became free of his phobia he regained his health. 
7. The Crow - Roaming around in Vennatat city a Buddhist monk met a Jain 
shraman. In order to pull his leg he posed a question tothe Jain shraman - ""Muniraj! 
Your Arhat is omniscient. You are his able disciple. Can you give me simple 
information - how many crows are there in this city?"" The shraman at once 
understood the conspiracy at the back of this question. He accordingly gave a clever 
answer - ""Bhante! This is hardly a question of consequence. The city has sixty 
thousand two hundred and sixty three crows. You may count them. If you find the 
number a little less, know that some of the local crows have gone out for site seeing. 
However, if you find the number a little more, consider that some crows from other 
cities are visiting.""His arrogance having shattered by the autpattiki buddhi of the Jain 
shraman, the Buddhist monk felt ashamed and went away. 
8. Stool Test - Once a man was going some where with his newly wedded 
beautiful wife. On the way a charlatan joined them and started talking to his wife. 
Soon he spun his web over the young woman and tried to take her away. When the 
husband stopped him, the charlatan started a quarrel claiming the woman to be his 
wife. At last they went to the judge. After hearing to the story the judge, first of all, 
send them all too different rooms. Then he went to the gentleman and asked him - 
""What did you eat yesterday."" The man informed - ""I and my wife both ate cookies 
made of sesame seeds."" After this the judge went to the charlatan and posed the 
same question. The charlatan gave names of some other eatables. 
After this the judge arranged for administering purgative to the charlatan and 
the woman and consequently got their stool test done. It was found that the stool of 
the woman contained sesame seeds and that of the charlatan did not. Thus the 'truth 
was revealed. The woman was returned to the gentleman and the charlatan was 
punished. 
9. The Elephant - A king needed a wise minister. To search an intelligent 
man with autpattiki buddhi the king got a large elephant tethered in the public park of 
the town and made an announcement that the man who weighs this elephant exactly 
will be rewarded. 
Numerous persons came, saw the elephant and returned back disheartened 
thinking that first of all how would they get such a large weighing scale? And even if 
they got it, how would they put the elephant in it? After many days passed, a man 
came and claimed that he will find the exact weight of the elephant. With the help of 
the king's men he took the elephant to the lake outside the town. He then arranged 
to bring a large boat near the shore and with the help of a gang-plank made the 
elephant walk into the boat. He marked the level to which the boat had submerged in 
water and brought back the elephant to shore. After this he started filling the boat 
with stones till the boat once again submerged up to the marked level. Now he 
transferred all the stone on shore and started weighing them with the help of a 
normal weighing scale. Some time later, when the weighing was over he added up 
the figures and told the exact weight of the elephant. The man was taken to the king

for reward. The king was impressed by his astonishing wisdom and rewarded him by 
appointing him as his minister. 
10. Court Jester - A king had a favourite court jester whom he! Gave too 
much liberty. The king always praised his wife before this! Man. He also stressed 
that she was very obedient. One day the jester commented - ""Sir! The queen's 
behaviour is guided by her self interest. If you don't believe, you may verify this by 
some test. 
Provoked by the jester the king one day asked his queen - ""Darling! I have 
this wish of marrying again and make the offspring from this marriage my heir 
apparent. The queen replied - ""My lord! You are well withinyour rights to marry once 
more and you are welcome. But as per the tradition the heir apparent can only be the 
eldest son."" When the jester's opinion was confirmed the king i laughed heartily. The 
queen asked the reason for this laughter and the king told her about his discussion 
with the jester. The queen got! Infuriated and forced the king to issue orders for the 
jester’s exile. 
The jester could guess who was at the back of this order. He! Collected a 
heap of shoes, made a large bundle, lifted it on his head and went to bid farewell to 
the queen. The queen asked with surprise - ""What makes you carry so much weight 
on your head?"" The jester replied - ""Your Highness! I have collected as many pair of! 
Shoes as I could in this bundle. As long as this whole lot lasts I will walk far and near 
to different villages and towns and tell everyone I meet about who exiled me and 
why.""When the queen heard this she was apprehensive about her possible 
disrepute. She at once requested the king and got the exile order rescinded. The 
jester saved himself with his Autpattiki Buddhi. 
11. The Shellac Ball - A little boy playfully inserted a shellac ball in his nostril 
and it got stuck there. It was painful. The boy had difficulty in breathing. The 
disturbed parents started searching for a doctor. Just then a goldsmith happened to 
pass by. When he saw the boy crying he asked ""what was the problem?"" When the 
parents told him about the incident he reassured them - ""Don't worry. I will just take 
out the ball."" He asked for a thin steel rod and heated it. When it gained the required 
temperature he carefully pushed it into the shellac ball inside the nostril. The shellac 
melted a little and the rod stuck to the ball. Now he carefully pulled out the ball. 
12. The Pillar - A king required a sharp-witted minister. In order to find such a 
man he planned a strange test. In a large pond outsidethe town he got a pillar 
erected at the centre of the pond. After thishe made an announcement that any 
person who ties a rope aroundthis pillar without getting into the water will be 
rewarded. 
After the announcement, many persons came and tried to find some way to 
tie to the piller. Many days passed but still no one was able to accomplish this 
seemingly imposible task. At last one day a witty individual came and carefully 
looked at the piller and all around the pond. 
He thaught a liitle to find a solution and brought a very long rope and a large 
spike. First of all he selected a point and hammered the spike in the ground and then 
tied one end of the rope to the spike. Now he took the coil of rope in his hand and 
started walking.As he took a step he realesed a short length of the rope in his hand. 
This way he walked around the pond and returned at the starting point. The rope had 
now encircled the piller. He tied the second end of the rope with the first and 
proceeded to get his prize from the king.

Impressed by his Autpattat Buddhi the king rewarded him and made him a 
minister. 
13. Kshullak (a type of Jain ascetic clad in a single piece of cloth and is in 
process of becoming completely non-clad) - Once there lived a sanyasini (a female 
mendicant) in a town. She was very proud of her knowledge and conduct. One day 
she went to the king's assembly and addressed the king, ""Sir, there is no one in the 
town that can defeat me in a debate."" This conceited remark disturbed the king and 
he made an announcement that he who defeats the sanyasini will be richly 
rewarded. In spite of this announcement no one came to confront the sanyasini. 
Some days later a Kshullak decided to melt the sanyasini's ego and came to the 
assembly. 
The sanyasini laughed when she saw the challenger - ""Ha! This shaved head 
will face me!"" The Kshullak did not react. He could assess the cunning mind of the 
sanyasint by her utterance and decided to employ a suitable trick. He said - ""You will 
have to accept defeat if you cannot do what I do."" The conceited sanyasini thought 
that there was hardly anything that the petty Kshullak could do and she could not. 
She said - ""I accept your challenge."" The Kshullak was eager to hear this reply. He 
at once caught hold of the arm of the nearest courtier and made him stand. He now 
took off the only cloth covering his body and wrapped it around the courtier. He 
turned to face the sanyasini and said - ""Now do as I did."" The sanyasini looked at the 
now nude Kshullak and at once shifted her gaze. She uttered shyly - ""No, I can't do 
this."" Her ego shattered, she accepted her defeat and went to her place. 
14. The Path - A man with his wife was going to another village on a chariot. 
On the way his wife asked him to stop the chariot and went to a nearby bush to 
relieve her. On a roadside tree lived a witch. She was attracted towards this man. 
She transformed herself into the form, of the man's wife and came to sit near him in 
the chariot. The man started the chariot. Just then the real wife came out of the 
bush. Pointing at her the witch said - ""Look! Some witch has taken my form and is 
coming in our direction. Please increase the speed of the chariot."" 
Before the man could increase the speed the real wife arrived near the 
chariot. Running along the chariot she pleaded - ""Please stop the chariot, my Lord ! 
The one who is sitting with you is some witch disguised as me."" The man was in a 
quandary. He shifted his gaze from one woman to the other and thought - what to 
do, how to spot the real one. He reduced the speed of the chariot. 
By this time they arrived near a village. The man went to the local panchayat 
(a group of five village elders) and narrated his story. The old head of the panchayat 
was very experienced. He applied his Autpattiki Buddhi. He made the two women 
stand about ten to twelve steps away from the man and said to them - ""The lady 
who' first touches this man will be accepted as his wife."" 
Hearing this real wife started running towards her husband. The witch just 
extended her hand and touched the man. The village head said - ""The disguise has 
been removed now."" The man got his wife and the witch disappeared. 
15. The Woman - There were two friends named Mooldev and Pundareek. 
One day they were going somewhere. On the same path a man was also walking 
with his wife. When Pundareek saw this woman, he got infatuated with her beauty. 
He said to Mooldev - ""Friend, if I do not get this woman I will die."" This made 
Mooldev worried. In order to save his friends life he took a detour and went a long 
distance ahead of the couple on the same path. There he made Pundareek sit 
 
NandiSootra 
 
Aagam- 44 -NandiSootra 
~ 68 ~ 
Compiled by- Deepratnasagar 
 
behind a thick bush. He himself now approached the - advancing couple and 
pleaded humbly - ""Brother, my wife is about to deliver a child. If you could send your 
wife for some time behind that bush I will be much obliged."" The man believed 
Mooldev and sent his wife. The woman was clever. She went behind the bush and 
returned soon. With a smile she said to Mooldev in a loud voice - ""Congratulations! 
You have got a beautiful son."" And the couple went ahead. Pundareek was filled with 
shame at this biting taunt. Mooldev took him along and procuded ahead. 
16. Husbands - Two brothers lived in a village. They had the same wife. She 
was very clever and never revealed which of the brothers she loved most. The 
villagers praised her for this quality. In time this news reached the king also. He was 
also impressed, but his minister said - ""Sir, It is impossible. It is for sure that the 
woman loves one of her husbands more than the other."" The king asked - ""How to 
find about this?"" The minister said - ""I will soon think of some way."" 
One day the minister send an order to the woman that she should send one of 
her husbands to a certain village in the east and the other to another village towards 
west. Getting this order the woman sent the husband she loved more to the village in 
the west so that while going as well as coming, the sun is on his back and the heat is 
less oppressive. The one she loved less, she sent to the, eastern village so that he 
walks facing the sun. The minister informed the king of this but the king was not 
satisfied. 
Once again the minister sent an order to her to send her husbands to two 
different destinations at the same time. The woman complied the order but this time 
the minister sent two different messengers to her after a lapse of few hours. They 
both carried the same message but from different villages - ""Your husband is sick 
and needs your care."" The woman at once said about one of her husbands - ""This is 
nothing new, he gets sick now and then. First I should go to see the other one. He 
must be in pain."" And she left to see the husband she loved more. The minister 
satisfied the king by giving all these details. 
17. The Son - There lived a merchant in a town. He had twowives. One had a 
son and the other was barren. But the two of themtook care of the child with same 
affection and love. Due to thisuniform behaviour even the child was not aware that 
which of thembwas his true mother. Once the merchant went out on a foreign tour 
with his family. Unfortunately he died on the way. After his deaththere was a dispute 
between the two wives. Saying that the sonbelonged to her, they both claimed the 
merchants property. 
When the differences increased they went to court. The judge ordered to slit 
the child into two pieces and give each wife one piece.  This strange order did not 
bring out any reaction from one of thewomen, whereas the other broke into tears and 
said - ""No! Not at all! Kindly don't slit the child. This is her son not mine. Please hand 
over the child to her. Also, give her my share of the wealth. She will need it to take 
proper care of the growing child. The judge saw this spontaneous flow of affection 
and care and at once understood that she was the real mother. At no cost a mother 
could tolerate killing of her son. Accordingly he released the son and the wealth to 
the real mother and punished the impostor. 
(STORIES OF VERSE-3) 
1. The Honey-comb - A weaver had an infidel wife. Once when the weaver 
had gone out of the village on some errand she established illicit relations with 
 
NandiSootra 
 
Aagam- 44 -NandiSootra 
~ 69 ~ 
Compiled by- Deepratnasagar 
 
another person. To meet her lover she went to a thicket of Jaal trees outside the 
village. There was a- honey-comb on one of the trees in this thicket. The weaver 
returned and the couple resumed there normal routine. Whenever she got an 
opportunity the wife went to the Jaal tree thicket for her love so journs. 
One day the weaver had need of some honey. When he was about to go to 
the market to buy honey, his wife said - ""There is no need to buy honey. I will show 
you a large honey-comb."" She took the weaver to the Taal tree thicket and pointed at 
the honey-comb. The weaver saw the honeycomb and also carefully inspected the 
solitary place. With the help of his Autpattiki Buddhi he took no time to understand 
that there was no reason for her wife to come to this forlorn place and be familiar 
with it, but that she was in love with some person and this was there secret meeting 
place. 
2. The Ring - In a town there lived a priest who was famous as a truthful and 
upright person. Hearing of his fame, once a labour came to him and deposited all his 
wealth amounting to one thousand gold coins in a bag and left the town in search of 
work. After a long period he returned and came to the priest to take back his bag of 
gold coins. The priest refused to recognise him and said - ""Who are you? What 
deposit you are talking about?” 
The labour was taken aback. Losing all his hard earned wealth made him 
insane. He started roaming around on the main street of the town uttering - ""My bag 
of one thousand gold coins!” 
One day he came across the prime minister of the kingdom. Taking him to be 
the priest he asked - ""O revered one, please give me back my bag of one thousand 
gold coins I deposited with you."" 
Seeing his condition the minister at once understood that there was 
something black at the bottom. He reassured the labour and took him along to the 
king. When the king heard the story of the labour he summoned the priest. When the 
priest came to the court, the king asked - ""Great Brahman, why don't you return the 
deposit this man made with you?"" The priest offered the same reply to the king - ""Sir! 
I don't even know this person; neither do I have any deposit from him."" 
When the priest left, the king asked the labour to tell his story in detail. 
Collecting his wits the labour told in details the size and colour of his bag; the date 
on which he had deposited it with the priest; and even where the priest had kept it 
after accepting. 
A few days later finding an opportune moment, the king called the priest for a 
game of chess. While the priest was engrossed in thegame the king glibly talked the 
priest into exchanging the ring in his finger. After some time the king excused himself 
for relieving. He furtively instructed his personal attendant to go to the priest's house, 
show the priest's wife his ring, and tell her that the priest has asked him to fetch from 
her the bag of that particular colour filled with one thousand gold coins and placed at 
that particular place. 
When the priest's wife saw his ring she believed that the message was from 
her husband only. She at once took out the bag and gave it to the king's attendant. 
The king placed that bag with a heap of his own bags and called the labour. From 
the heap of the bags the labour at once recognised and pointed at his own bag. The 
king was pleased to let him take his bag and punished the priest. 
3. The Number - Once a person deposited a noli of one Thousand rupees 
(noli is a cloth bag of exact volume of a specified number of coins and is stitched

close after placing that number of coins in it) with a merchant and went out on tour. 
In the mean time the merchant skilfully cut out the bottom of the noli, replaced the 
rupee coins with counterfeits (which are slightly thinner), and stitched it back. A few 
days later the owner of the noli returned and the merchant returned his noli to him. 
When this person returned home and opened the n, oli he was disappointed to see 
the counterfeit coins. He at once went to the court with the noli and the coins. The 
judge after hearing out his story asked about how many rupees he had placed in the 
noli. The man informed that he had kept one thousand rupees in the noli. The judge 
called for one thousand rupees and filled them in the noli. He found that the number 
of coins left out from the noli matched the length cut out from the noli. He believed in 
the truthfulness of the person. He summoned the merchant and odered him to give 
back the thousand rupees to the person. The merchant got a punishment as well. 
4. Nanak - Once a person deposited one thousand gold coins in a sealed and 
signed bag with a merchant and went out on tour. He returned after many years. 
During this period the merchant skilfully removed the seal, replaced the gold coins 
with made to order brass replicas and sealed it back without leaving a sign. 
When the owner of the bag returned, the merchant gave him back his bag. 
The man examined the bag and the seal and finding everything intact accepted the 
delivery. When he reached home, opened the bag and found brass coins he cursed 
his luck. He filed his complaint with the court’ The judge summoned the merchant 
also. With both parties present he asked the complainant about how many years had 
passed since he deposited the bag with the merchant? The man informed that five 
years had passed. The merchant also confirmed this statement. Now the judge 
examined the brass coins and found that they had been made recently; at the most 
one year back. The merchant was caught in his deceit and was punished. The gold 
coins were returned to the rightful owner. 
5. The Mendicant - Once a person deposited one thousand gold coins with a 
mendicant and went out on tour. A few days later he returned and asked for his coins 
from the mendicant who resorted to biding time. Even after a considerable time when 
the mendicant did not return the coins the man started searching for some way to 
recover his wealth. 
While he was still thinking about it he came across some gamblers. During 
conversation when he told about his problem the gamblers assured him that they will 
help him recover his wealth from the mendicant. They gave him instructions and left. 
Next day they dressed themselves in ochre robes and disguised as mendicants went 
to that mendicant. They requested him - ""We have these gold pegs which we want to 
deposit with you for safe keeping. We are going out of the town on a tour and our 
problem is that we have no place to keep these costly pegs. You are a saint and a 
truthful individual and have no fondness for wealth. What better person can we find 
than you?"" 
While the talks were going on the former depositor came there according to 
the plan. He said - ""Revered once, please give me back my bag of one thousand 
gold coins that I had deposited with you before going on tour."" 
The mendicant thought that if he refused now, a scene would be created and 
these mendicants will not deposit their highly valuable pegs with me. He at once 
returned the gold coins to the man in order to impress the disguised mendicants with 
his honesty. The overjoyed man left for his home. Now the gamblers also left on 
some pretext. The mendicant realised that they had made a fool of him.

6. Chetak Nidhan - Two close friends once went out of the town into a jungle 
for some work. While they, were digging a hole at a spotin the jungle they found a 
pile of hidden treasure. The friends were elated to see so much of gold. One of them 
proposed - ""Friend, we are extremely lucky that we have suddenly come across such 
a large treasure. But we will carry it home tomorrow only, and not today. This is 
because tomorrow is a very auspicious day."" This man was crafty and the other one 
a guileless. This sincere one believed what was said and they both returned home. 
The crafty one returned to the spot during the night, took out the treasure and 
replaced it with a heap of coal. 
Next day, at the appointed time the two friends went into the jungle and 
started digging for the treasure. Seeing coal instead the crafty one started crying 
profusely. In between, he would glance at his friend and utter - ""How ill fated we are 
that we have been deprived of the treasure and given coal instead. The sincere one, 
though simple, was not a fool. He realised that his friend had played a trick on him. 
He at once resolved to teach his friend a lesson. However, he said - ""Friend, don't be 
so distressed, one only gets what he is destined to. Come let's go home."" And the 
two friends left. 
The sincere one, after returning home, called an expert sculptor and got a 
statue of his friend in sitting posture made. When ready, he placed the statue in a 
room. After this he got two pet monkeys. When he had to feed the monkeys he 
would place the eatables on the shoulders, head or thighs of the statue. The 
monkeys would playfully jump and perch on the statue to eat. Within a few days they 
became so familiar with the statue and its connection with the food that whenever 
they wanted to eat they would come and sit in the lap or shoulders of that replica of a 
human figure. The sincere one would at once feed them. 
When he was confident that the monkeys had perfectly learnt what he 
wanted, the sincere one day invited the two young sons of his crafty friend for lunch. 
The crafty was pleased to send both his sons. The sincere one fed them with loving 
care and hid them at a secret place with a heap of toys. 
In the evening, by the time the crafty came to fetch his sons, the sincere one 
had already removed the statue and spread a mattress in its place. He asked the 
crafty to sit on the mattress. He then brought some snacks and placed before his 
friend. As soon as the crafty sat-down, two monkeys came from another room. One 
sat in his lap and the other on his shoulders and started playing. It appeared as if 
they were closely familiar with the crafty. The sincere one started giving snacks to 
the monkeys with a gloom clearly visible on his face. 
The crafty asked with surprise - ""Friend, what is the matter? These little 
monkeys came to me and are playfully eating as if they know me well."" 
The sincere one said - ""I fail to find words, my friend! Why won't these 
monkeys recognise you? After all they are your sons. Cruel fate has turned them into 
monkeys."" 
The crafty turned white with shock. He stood up quickly, took hold of his 
friend's hand and uttered in dismay - ""Friend! Is it a cruel joke! How can human 
beings turn into monkeys?” 
""Friend, the ways of fate and karma are strange and powerful. When bad luck 
can turn gold into coal, why can't it turn humans into monkeys? It must be the fruition 
of your bad karmas.""

The crafty understood everything. He thought that if he disputed, the matter 
would go to the king. Without gaining anything he would lose all his wealth. He had 
got his lesson. He at once told the actual story about the treasure, begged his 
friend's pardon and shared the treasure with his friend. The sincere one also 
returned the little boys. This is a good example of Autpattiki Buddhi. 
7. Education (of archery) - Travelling around an expert archer once came to 
a town. The inhabitants of the town came to know of his expertise and many young 
boys from wealthy families came to him to learn archery. When their education was 
complete they gave their teacher a big purse of money as gift. When the guardians 
of these boys got this news they were annoyed. They all unanimously decided that 
when the archer leaves for his village, they will apprehend him, beat him up and 
recover all the money. 
The archer somehow came to know of this conspiracy against him. He 
furtively sent a message to his friends in his village that on the coming fifteenth day 
of the bright half of this month he will throw some dung-balls in the river. These 
floating balls will reach their village, which was down river, after some time. These 
balls should bepicked out from the river and carefully stored till he came back. He 
then collected a heap of cow-dung and made balls from it concealing a portion of his 
wealth in each ball. After all his money was concealed in the balls he left them to dry. 
At an opportune moment he called his students and said - ""It is my family 
tradition that after the education of my students is complete, on an auspicious day 
after a dip in the holy river; dung-balls are thrown in the river with chanting of 
mantras. This signifies the throwing away of dung-like-ignorance. Your education is 
complete now; therefore we shall have this convocation function on the coming 15th 
of the bright half of the month. 
On the fixed date the function was organised. In presence of the prominent 
citizens of the town all the dung-balls were thrown m the river with mantra chanting. 
As planned, the archer's friends in his village were waiting for the floating balls. They 
collected all the balls, tied them carefully into a bundle and stored the bundle at a 
secure place. 
A few days later the archer announced his date of departure. When that day 
arrived all his students came to bid him farewell. The curious guardians also came. 
In their presence the archer bid everyone good bye and left as he was standing, 
dressed as when he had come. He carried nothing in his hand in which he could 
carry the presumed large purse of wealth. The guardians were surprised to see that 
he was going back as poor as he had come. They accepted what they saw, that he 
was carrying no wealth and dropped their idea of way laying him. 
8. Ethics - A person had two wives. One had a son and the other was barren. 
But the two of them took care of the child with same affection and love. Due to this 
uniform behaviour even the child was not aware that which of them his true mother 
was. Once that merchant came to Ayodhya, the city where king Megh (the father of 
Bhagavan Sumatinath) ruled. Unfortunately he died there. After his death there was 
a dispute between the two wives about the son because property rights belonged the 
real mother of the son. 
The dispute finally reached king Megh. He also was unable to come to a 
conclusion. When queen Sumangala came to know of this shecalled the two women 
and said - ""I am pregnant and will give birth to a son after a few months. When he 
becomes major after some years he will decide about your casf. Till then you all live 
 
NandiSootra 
 
Aagam- 44 -NandiSootra

here in my palace.""The barren woman thought - ""This is a good opportunity. It will 
take many years for the queen's son to grow, why not enjoy the regal comforts of the 
palace.""'And she at once gave her consent. The real mother was in a quandary. She 
wanted the son not the regal comforts. But how to tell this to the queen; she might 
get angry. 
The queen at once understood that the woman who had accepted her 
proposal was the barren one. She was punished. The son was given to the real 
mother. 
9. ""Give me, what you like"" - There lived a merchant in a city. He suddenly 
died one day. It was difficult for his wife to manage the business he left. She could 
not even recover the money the merchant had loaned on interest. At last she called 
another merchant, who was a friend of her deceased husband and said - ""I would 
request you to help me recover from the market the loans advanced by my 
husband."" This friend was very selfish. He gave a proposal - ""If you give me some 
cut from the recovery, I can recover the entire loan. The lady replied - ""Give me, 
what you like."" The selfish man got what he wanted. Very soon he recovered all the 
money. He divided the money into two parts - one very large and the other very 
small. He gave the lesser amount to the lady who refused to take it and instead took 
the matter to the court. 
The lady explained to the judge the terms of the agreement and said that the 
selfish friend was going against what he promised. The judge got the point. He called 
for the wealth and divided into two heaps as desired by the selfish friend. Now he 
asked the offender - ""Tell me which of the heaps you like?"" The offender pointed at 
the large heap and said - ""My lord, I like this one."" The judge said - ""According the 
contract you have confirmed, you have to give this lady what you like. You have just 
said that you like the larger heap therefore you have to give the larger heap to this 
lady."" 
The selfish friend was caught in his own trap. He cursed himself on his 
foolishness and took the smaller heap away. The lady returned home with her 
wealth. 
10. A Hundred Thousand - There was a parivrajak (a type of monk) with 
exceptionally sharp meinory. Whatever he listened once he remembered verbatim. 
He had a large silver pot which he called Khotak. Proud of his memory he one day 
declared before a large audience - ""Whoever narrates something that I have not 
already heard will be rewarded with this large Khotak."" Hearing of this challenge 
many persons came and told numerous stories. But after hearing any story told to 
him the parivrajak would repeat it verbatim and claim that he already knew it. 
A witty person understood the clever trick the partvrajak was playing. He 
decided to teach the parivrajak a lesson by ensnaring him in his own trap. The fame 
of the parivrajak and the sessions of story telling became so popular that now the 
competition became a part of the king's court. At an opportune moment the witty 
person went to the court and said that he would recite a verse that the parivrajak can 
never have heard. The partvrajak smiled confidently and said - ""Indeed! Come, you 
also display your expertise."" 
The witty person recited in a loud voice so that everyone in the court, 
including the king, could hear clearly what he said- 
""Your father owes my father a hundred thousand rupees. 
If you have not heard of this give me the Khotak. If you have, and you are

honest, pay me back the hundred thousand rupees."" 
The partvrajak was taken aback. Hearing this real wife started running 
towards her husband. The witch just He was caught in his own trap. He had to 
accept his defeat and part with his silver Khotak.

[103] MEANING -13.Sheetashati, 14.Rain-water and 15. Theft of Cattle, 
Deathof the Horse and Falling from a tree. 
COMMENTARY [101 to 103] - The stories compiled as examples of vanayiki 
Buddhi are as follows: 
1. Augury - In a town lived an expert augur. He had two disciples whom he 
liked equally. He taught them with same interest. One of the students was very 
modest and followed the teacher's instructions strictly. He listened to the lessons 
with keen attention and pondered over them regularly. Whenever there was some 
doubt, he put forth a question before the teacher and removed his doubt. Soon he 
acquired all knowledge and became an expert. The other student was immodest. He 
neither gave attention to what was taught nor did he ponder over the lessons. He 
found asking questions and removing doubts below his dignity. Due to this nature his 
education remained faulty and incomplete. 
Once the two students, on some errand, set out to go to a nearby village. On 
the road they saw large foot prints. The immodest commented - ""These appear to be 
foot prints of an elephant."" The modest informed - ""No friend, they are of a she-
elephant and it is blind in the left eye. Not only this, some woman from the royal 
family is riding that she-elephant. The woman is married and pregnant and will give 
birth to a son within a day or two. 
The immodest could not believe all these predictions based on mere foot 
prints. He asked - ""On what basis do you say that?"" The modest replied - ""After 
going some distance it will all be clear to you. The immodest was hurt and remained 
silent. Some time later they reached their destination. There they saw that on the 
banks of a lake was a camp site apparently of some rich person. On one side of the 
row of tents, stood a she-elephant blind in left eye. While the two young men were 
looking curiously at all this, a maid servant emerged out of a gorgeous tent and 
approached an impressive person with royal bearing and said - ""Minister Sir! Please 
go and congratulate the king. The queen has given birth to a son."" 
Getting all this information the modest said - ""See friend, what I told has 
proved to be true."" The immodest accepted grudgingly - ""Yes, your knowledge is 
perfect."" And they sat down under a tree to rest. 
A little later an old woman with water filled pitcher on her head passed that 
way. When she saw two scholarly looking young men she thought - ""They appear to 
be some learned augurs. Let me ask them when my son, who has gone away for 
work, will return."" She took a few steps, came near the two young men, and put her 
quarry to them.

Just then the pitcher on her head fell down and shattered. The water spilled 
out and vanished in the sand. 
Seeing all this the immodest said at once - ""Old lady, as this pitcher has 
broken so is your son dead."" 
The old lady was engulfed in a wave of distress. Now the modest said - ""Don't 
say that friend. Her son has already reached home."" He turned to the old lady and 
said - ""Mother, please rush back, your son awaits you there."" 
Reassured, the old lady left for her home. When she reached home, she saw 
that her son, with dust covered feet, was sitting at the gate and waiting for her. She 
embraced him with joy and at once traced back her steps to the young augur, taking 
along her son. She rewarded the modest and showered blessings on him. 
When the immodest realised that all his predictions proved wrong and those 
of his friend proved to be right, he became very sad. 
However, instead of finding his own shortcomings he was filled with a deep 
anger for his teacher - ""This is the result of my teacher's favouritism. He did not 
teach me properly."" When the two students returned to their teacher the modest 
bowed before the teacher with gratitude. But the immodest just stood there without 
even greeting the teacher. 
When the teacher raised a questioning eye, he complained - ""You have not 
taught me properly, therefore my knowledge is incomplete. Whereas you have 
taught this fellow with all sincerity so that his knowledge is complete. Such 
favouritism is not proper for a good teacher."" 
The teacher asked the modest with surprise - ""Son, what is the matter? Why 
your colleague feels like that? Tell me everything in detail."" 
The modest told the whole story exactly as it had happened. 
The teacher asked again - ""Now tell me about the grounds of your 
predictions."" 
The modest - ""Sir, by your grace I observed carefully that the foot prints 
belonged to an elephant. However, the distance between the spot where it urinated 
and the foot prints made me deduces that it was a female, not male. When I looked 
at the trees on both sides of the path I found signs of leaves and fruits snatched only 
from the trees on the right hand side. The trees on the left were intact. This told me 
that the she-elephant was blind in the left eye. With the foot prints of the elephant 
there were numerous other foot prints of men and women and foot prints of horses. 
This indicated that the person riding the elephant belonged to the royal family.  
A little further there were clear signs of the elephant squatting down and a 
lady getting down and going to a nearby clump of bushes to relieve herself. Some 
strands of silk and a few long hairs indicated that the lady was married and 
extremely rich. Therefore I thought that she must be thequeen. After urinating she 
got up leaving an imprint of her right palm on sand. This difficulty in getting up 
indicated that she was pregnant. Observing her foot prints carefully I gathered that 
she was favouring the left leg. Thus I knew that the delivery time was very near. 
Other signs indicated that she will give birth to a male child."" 
The teacher looked at him with pride and contentment. The student continued 
- ""When the pitcher slipped and broke immediately after the old lady asked her 
question, I deduced that like the sand made pitcher returned to its origin, the son has 
also returned to his mother.""

On hearing all this teacher praised the Modest. To the immodest he advised - 
""You do not follow my instructions, neither do you ponder over what you are taught 
and remove your doubts. That is the reason you can not acquire right and perfect 
knowledge. I have been giving you the same lessons and at the same time. But as 
you are not humble and modest your knowledge is incomplete. 
This is not due to any partiality on my part. It is the fault of your own attitude 
that is wanting in modesty and sincerity."" The immodest got ashamed of his 
behaviour and startedhis studies earnestly and humbly. 
 
2. Economics - In the same way the right and perfect knowledge of 
economics is acquired only if one is humble. 
3. Writing - The right and perfect skill of writing is also acquired only if one is 
humble. 
4. Mathematics - The right and perfect knowledge of mathematics and all 
other subjects is also acquired only if one is humble. 
5. The Well - water diviner very humbly studied with his teacher. He learned 
every lesson attentively and followed allinstructions sincerely. This way he acquired 
complete knowledge of the subject to become an accomplished water diviner. 
Once a villager took him to his farm and asked where to dig for a well. The 
water diviner applied all his skill and marked the right spot. He also told the farmer 
about the depth at which water will be available. The farmer dug a well accordingly 
but no water oozed out. He again went to the water diviner, who came to the farm 
and inspected the well carefully. After some deliberation he indicated a spot at the 
bottom of the well and said - ""Hit hard at this spot with your heel."" The farmer did as 
told and a stream of water broke out from that spot. The farmer joyously praised the 
water diviner and rewarded him liberally. Such expertise is acquired with the help of 
Vainayiki Buddhi. 
6. The Horse - Once many horse traders came to Dwarka to sell their horses. 
Many young princes in the city bought large and muscular horses. But a young man 
named Vasudev, an expert on horses, purchased a skinny looking horse that later 
won every race it entered. The reason for this was Vasudev's expertise of horses. He 
had very humbly acquired this knowledge from his teacher. Modesty sharpens 
intellect and helps widen experience and knowledge. 
7. The Donkeys - There was a young king in a city who believed that youth is 
the best- age and only a young man has ample power and capacity to work hard. 
Guided by this notion he gradually replaced all experienced and ageing warriors from 
his army with new and young recruits. 
Once he marched his army to attack another kingdom. The contingent lost its 
way and ended up in an arid and forlorn area. All efforts to find a way out failed. 
Every single soldier was dying with thirst. In this hopeless predicament a soldier 
advised the king - “Sir! We are unable to find a way out of this situation. Only some 
experienced old man could help us avoid the impending catastrophe."" The king 
announced that if there was any experienced old person in the army his suggestion 
was solicited. 
Luckily an elderly soldier, disguised as a young man, had joined the. Army. 
His son brought him to the king who courteously asked - ""Please do something that 
my army gets water to drink."" The elderly - soldier paused a little and then said - ""Sir! 
Let loose all the donkeys used for carrying supplies in the army. Let them roam 
around free and let our army follow where they lead. When they stop and start

sniffing the ground, dig out the earth there. ""The king accepted the advice and issued 
necessary instructions. Some distance farther the army found a good source of fresh 
water. With the help of the Vainayiki Buddhi of the experienced soldier the army 
came out of the painful situation. 
8. The Attributes - A merchant appointed a servant to look after his horses 
and promised to give him two horses of his choice as remuneration. The young man 
accepted the terms and started working. During the course of his working he fell in 
love with the merchant's daughter. The servant was intelligent and clever. He asked 
the girl - ""Which of the horses is the best?"" The girl explained - ""Generally speaking 
all these horses are good and pedigreed. But the horses that are not disturbed even 
by the sound of stone filled drums thrown from tree tops are considered best and 
have all the attributes of the best horse. 
Accordingly the servant examined all the horses in the stable and selected the 
two best horses. When it was time to take remuneration, he asked for those two 
horses. The merchant was in a fix - ""These two are the best and the most valuable 
horses of the lot I have. Giving these horses would be a great loss to me."" He tried to 
persuade the servant to take any two horses other than the two he had selected, but 
he refused to compromise. 
The confused merchant went inside the house and told his wife - ""This servant 
is very clever and intelligent. He has selected the best two of our horses. Rather than 
to lose all our wealth, it would be better to marry our daughter to him and force him 
to stay with usforever."" 
This infuriated the wife - ""Have you gone mad? You want to marry our dear 
daughter to a servant?” 
The merchant explained - ""If we lose those two valuable horses we will incur a 
great and irreparable loss. The horses are not only immensely valuable but also 
auspicious for us. Moreover, the servant is a virtuous person. By making him our 
son-in-law we will save our horses and at the same time get a sincere man to take 
proper care of our horses and increase our stock. Getting such a handsome 
andintelligent husband, our daughter will also be happy and shall remain with us 
always."" At last the wife gave her consent and the merchant married his daughter to; 
the servant. They lived happily ever after. The Vainayiki Buddhi helped the merchant 
save his wealth. 
9. The knot - In Patliputra once there was a king named Murund. One day 
some other king sent three strange and puzzling things to him and asked him to 
provide a solution. The things were - an endless cotton thread, a bamboo stick 
without a knot, and a lidless box. 
The king showed these things to all the members of his assembly and asked 
them to explain. Each member examined the three things carefully. After that 
expressing their surprise and showing their inability to provide any explanation they 
all returned to their respective seats. The king now invited Padliptasuri and asked - 
""Bhante! Can you explain these strange things?"" Acharyashri carefully looked at the 
three things and understood that the joints and knots of the three objects were 
skilfully concealed by applying shellac of matching colour. He asked the king to 
arrange for a large pot filled with boiling water. When the pot was brought the three 
objects were placed in boiling water. The shellac cover melted away. The lighter end 
of the stick emerged out of water and its knots became visible. The end of the 
endless cord also became visible. In absence of the shellac covering the lid of the

Aagam- 44 -NandiSootra 
~ 78 ~ 
Compiled by- Deepratnasagar 
 
box also became clearly visible. The king and his courtiers warmly praised 
Acharyashri and his Vainayiki Buddhi. 
Now the king requested Acharyashri that he should advise about some such 
strange and puzzling thing that could be sent to the friendly king in reciprocation. 
Acharyashri asked him to get a gourd fruit. Under his supervision the gourd was 
carefully cut in the middle and its hollow was filled with some gems. After that the 
two pieces were joined and the joint was skilfully covered with shellac of matching 
colour. The joint became invisible and the gourd looked fresh and natural as before. 
The king sent this gourd to his friend with a message that he should take out the 
gems within the gourd without breaking it. A few days later the king got the news that 
no one could take out the gems from the gourd. The king was pleased. He thanked 
and praised Acharyashri. 
10. Agad - There was a king in a small city. As small was his city so was his 
army. Once a neighbouring and powerful king attacked and laid siege around his 
city. When the king failed to find a way to save his town he made an announcement 
that whoever had whatever poison, he should bring it to the king. Numerous people 
brought numerous different types of poison in large quantities. The king, with the 
help of his spies, arranged to drop all this poison in the well, outside the town, which 
was the only source of drinking water for the attacking army. 
Once this was done a doctor (वैद्य) came with a small bottle of poison. When 
the king saw this, he got angry - ""You have come so late, doctor! And that too with 
this tiny bottle of poison?"" The doctor explained - ""Sir! Please don't get agitated. This 
is a highly toxic poison. This small bottle can kill much more people than all the 
poison you have collected till now."" 
Raising his eye brows the king asked - ""How is it possible? Can you prove?"" 
The doctor requested for an old elephant to be brought there. When it was 
brought, the doctor plucked out a hair from its tail and applied the poison with the tip 
of a needle at that pore. As the poison spread into the elephant's body it started 
going limp. The doctor said - ""Sir! The poison will slowly contaminate the whole body 
of this elephant. Whoever eats its flesh will also be poisoned. That is why this is 
called Sahasrabedhi (destroyer of one thousand) poison; in other words, a highly 
toxic poison."" 
The king believed what the doctor had said. Seeing the elephant fall, the king 
said - ""Doctor, the poor elephant is dying just for nothing. Can you cure it with some 
anti-dote. The doctor said - ""Why not. A doctor who does not know about an anti-
dote of a poison he has administered, is no doctor."" And he administered an anti-
dote into the same pore. Soon the elephant regained its strength. 
The doctor had gained this profound knowledge through his Vainayiki Buddhi. 
11, 12.The Charioteer and the Courtesan - These examples are part ofthe 
story of Sthulbhadra. 
13. Sheetashati (etc.) - In a town there was a very greedy king, His sons 
studied with a great scholar. The princes were generous and modest. This inspired 
the teacher to teach them very sincerely. Whentheir education was complete the 
princes gave their teacher a large purse of money as gift. Some how the king came 
to know of this and thought of killing the scholar to get this purse. The conspiracy 
was revealed to the princes. Driven by their profound respect and love for their 
teacher the princes decided to secretly warn him to save his life.

All the three princes visited their teacher. When they arrived the teacher was 
preparing to take his bath before going to eat. He greeted his students and asked 
them to fetch a washed and dried shatika ( or sheetashati or dhoti - about five meters 
length of cloth of one meter width wrapped around the lower half of the body by 
Indian male as part of his conventional dress). One of the princes said - ""The shatika 
is damp."" The second one said - ""The straw is long."" And third - ""The curlew bird that 
was earlier moving in clock-wise direction is now moving in anti-clockwise direction."" 
When the teacher heard these irrelevant statements from his able students he 
smelled a rat. He pondered over and understood that his large purse has made 
someone his enemy and his students are secretly giving him a warning. He at once 
took leave of his students and furtively left for his village before the announced time 
of his departure. The Vatnayikt Buddhi of the princes saved the life of their teacher. 
14. Rain-water - A merchant had gone abroad since long. In his absence his 
wife asked her maid to invite a young man to satisfy her carnal desires. She also 
called a barber to improve the looks of the shabby young man. The barber gave him 
the full treatment - haircut, pedicure, manicure, bath, etc. - and made him attractive. 
Coincidentally it rained heavily that night. Late into the night when the gigolo 
got thirsty he got up, went to the window, cupped his hands, and sipped the rain 
water falling in a stream from the balustrade. On the balustrade was lying a dead 
snake that made this stream of rain-water poisonous. Soon the young man died. 
The lady panicked and at once called the servants of her confidence. She 
instructed them to throw the corpse in the forlorn ruins of a temple. Next day when 
some people saw the corpse and reported, the police started investigating. The 
officer in charge saw that the dead man had been freshly hair-dressed and 
manicured. He at once summoned all the barbers in the town and one by one 
askedthem to recognise the corpse. One of the barbers recognised the dead body 
and informed that he had done the haircut of that man when he was called by the 
maid of the merchant's wife. The police apprehended the maid and out of fear she 
revealed everything. With the help of Vainayiki Buddhi the officer solved the case. 
15. Theft of cattle - In a village once lived a very unlucky man. He spoiled 
whatever work he took in hand and always, invited trouble. Once he asked for a pair 
of oxen from his friend for use in his plough. After completing his work when he went 
to return the oxen to his friend, the friend was taking his meals. He left the oxen in 
the yard and left without informing the friend, presuming that his friend had seen him 
returning the oxen. His bad luck that the oxen somehow came out of the yard and 
someone stole them. When the owner of the oxen did not find the oxen in the yard 
he came to this luckless man and wanted his oxen back. When the luckless told him 
that the oxen were returned to his yard before him, a dispute arose. The owner of 
oxen took the luckless along and left for the city to take the matter to the king. 
On the way they saw a rider approaching them. All of a sudden the horse was 
startled. It threw the rider and galloped. The rider shouted - ""Some one hit the horse 
with a staff and stop' it."" 
The luckless had a staff in his hand. With the intention of extending a helping 
hand to the fallen rider the luckleis stepped ahead and hit the approaching horse 
with his staff. Unfortunately the staff hit the horse at a delicate spot and it died on the 
spot. The owner of the horse got infuriated and joined the two in order to get the 
unfortunate man punished by the king. Now the three proceeded towards the city. 
By the time they reached the city, it was already night time and the city gates 
 
NandiSootra 
 
Aagam- 44 -NandiSootra 
~ 80 ~ 
Compiled by- Deepratnasagar 
 
were closed. To wait till morning the three slept under a dense tree near the gate. 
The luckless had no sleep in his eyes. He was deep in thoughts - ""Luck does not 
favour me. I try to do good and in turns bad. Death is better than such miserable life. 
I will be rid of all troubles."" 
With these thoughts he got up, tied one end of his scarf to a branch of the tree 
and making a noose at the other end hung himself. Even the death did not favour the 
unlucky. The rotten old scarf could not take his weight and was torn apart. Under the 
tree was also sleeping a team of acrobats. The luckless fell on them and their chief 
died on the spot. There was a commotion in the group of the acrobats and at last 
they also joined these three to get the luckless punished by the king. 
When this crowd reached the king's assembly everyone was surprised. When 
the king asked about the cause of so many people coming together, every 
complainant lodged his complaint. Now the king looked at the luckless. Accepting all 
the charges the luckless said - ""Sir, I did not do anything intentionally. I am so 
unlucky that anything I do with good intention turns bad. They all are telling the truth. 
Whatever punishment you decide for me, I am prepared to accept."" 
The king was very considerate and just. He could understand that the 
innocent man was not at fault. It is not right to punish him for the fault of fate. He felt 
pity for the luckless and drawing on his profound experience and vainayiki buddhi he 
very cleverly gave his judgement. 
First of all he called the owner of the oxen and said - ""If you want your oxen 
back first take out your eyes and give them to this man. This is because with these 
very eyes you saw this man taking the oxen into your yard.""After this he called the 
owner of the horse - ""If you want your horse, first cut out your tongue and give it to 
him; because with the help of this very tongue you said to hit the horse with a staff. 
Punishing him is not justified as long as your tongue is not punished."" 
In the end he called the acrobats and said - ""This poor man has nothing that 
he can be asked to give you. If at all you want to take revenge I will order him to 
sleep under the same tree. The chief, now among you, should tie a noose in his neck 
and hang from that very branch. He will fall on this man and this man will die. Thus 
the debt will be paid."" None of the three found words to challenge the king's 
judgement and they left as they had come. The luckless also returned after profusely 
thanking the king.

COMMENTARY [107 to 110] - 
1. Abhaya Kumar - Chandpradyot, the king oei Ujjaini, one day sent an 
emissary to his brother-in-law (husband orL his wife's sister), king Shrenik of 
Rajagriha, with a message - ""If youi want to live in peace at once send the unique 
Bunkchood necklace,! Sechanak elephant, Abhaya Kumar and queen Chelna to 
me.""King Shrenik was infuriated to get this message and said - ""An! Emissary enjoys 
immunity, so 1 am not giving you any punishment. ! Go back and tell your king that if 
he wants to live in peace he should send the Fire-chariot, Analgiri elephant, 
Vajrajangha the emissary, and queen Shiva Devi to me at once."" 
This answer added fuel to the fire. Chandpradyot attacked! Rajagriha with his 
large army and soon laid a siege around the city. i King Shrenik also made all 
necessary preparations. But his son; Abhaya Kumar, who was endowed with 
Parinamiki Buddhi, requested - ""Sir, please don't jump into the war at once. 
Chandpradyot could be defeated by intrigue without fighting a war. ! Kindly leave this 
job to me and rest assured."" The king had full confidence inhis son's wisdom, 
therefore he accepted this proposal. 
Abhaya Kumar arranged, stealthily, through his spies, to bury gold, gems and 
jewels around the camps of various commanders of Chandpradyot's army. After this 
he himself furtively went to meet Chandpradyot and after greeting said - ""Uncle, this 
time you are seriously caught in a political intrigue. You are dreaming of conquering 
Rajagriha and king Shrenik has bought allegiance of your prominent commanders by 
paying enough wealth. They are prepared to capture you and produce you before 
king Shrenik. Come morning you will be apprehended. You are my uncle; how can I 
see you insulted by such conspiracy? Please do something."" 
Hearing this Chandpradyot became alert. He asked Abhaya Kumar - ""Why 
should I believe you?""Abhaya Kumar - ""You need not believe me. Come see with 
your own eyes."" And in the dark of the night Chandpradyot covered himself in a 
black sheet and accompanied Abhaya Kumar to the camps of his commanders. 
Abhaya Kumar dug out the buried wealth. No doubt remained in the king's mind 
about the treachery of his commanders. He rode a horse and secretly returned to 
Ujjaini the same night.

In the morning the commanders were surprised not to find their king. Even his 
horse was not there. When they searched for him they found the hoof prints of the 
king's horse pointed in the direction of Ujjaini. Disturbed by this unexpected 
behaviour of their king they broke camp and 'started for Ujjaini. 
When the army reached Ujjaini the commanders went to the palace to see the 
king. At first he refused to meet them. After much persuasion he finally agreed to 
meet them. Before they could say a word he started reprimanding them for their 
treachery and accepting bribe. The commander-in-chief of his army replied humbly - 
""Sir! How could you believe that we could deceive you? For generations we are 
serving the state. We all love our country. There is no reason to betray you. It 
appears to be a conspiracy cooked by that crafty prince Abhaya Kumar. He took you 
into confidence and saved his state cleverly from a war."" 
This opened the eyes of Chandpradyot. His anger for Abhaya Kumar saw no 
bounds. He immediately made an announcement that the person who brings Prince 
Abhaya Kumar of Rajagriha to Ujjaini as a prisoner will be richly rewarded. The fame 
of Abhaya Kumar's sharp intelligence and cleverness was so wide spread that no 
one could muster enough courage to accept this challenge. The ministers, 
commanders, clever merchants, no one was ready to apprehend Abhaya Kumar. 
A few days later a courtesan took up the challenge. On the condition that she 
be given enough cash to cover her expenses. The king agreed at once. She took 
along a few other women and dressed as Shravikas they all reached Rajagriha. 
This group started regularly visiting religious places and attending to 
discourses of ascetics to impress upon the people that they are very devout 
shravikas. When they earned the desired reputation the courtesan planned and 
invited Abhaya Kumar to her place of stay. Considering her to be a co-religionist and 
a famed shravika, Abhaya Kumar accepted the invitation. The courtesan drugged the 
food offered to Abhaya Kumar. As soon as Abhaya Kumar ate his food he became 
unconscious. The courtesan was eagerly waiting for this. Abhaya Kumar was 
immediately tied up and carried to a chariot. The courtesan brought the victim to 
Ujjaini. 
When Abhaya Kumar was produced as a prisoner before king Chandpradyot 
his joy saw no bounds. He ridiculed, ""Why? Son, you got paid for your deceit. 
Howcunningly I got you apprehended and brought here.""Abhaya Kumar reacted 
without hesitation, ""Uncle, you caught me and brought me here when I was 
unconscious. Please beware; I will one day take you to Rajagriha on a chariot when 
you are wide awake and that too torturing you on the way. 
Chandpradyot took it to be a joke and did not pay any attention. Abhaya 
Kumar went to his aunt in the palace and lived happily. A few days later, when all 
these incidents were forgotten, he searched and found out a man who matched king 
Chandpradyot in appearance, body size and speech. He promised the man enough 
money and explained his plan. The man stayed with him. After a couple of days 
Abhaya Kumar dressed his accomplice as the king, took him in the. Chariot and 
beating him with a stick went around the streets of Ujjaini, as coached, the man 
moaned and wailed and shouted - ""See, Abhaya Kumar is beating me with a stick, 
some one; save me, help me!"" When the townspeople heard their king calling for ""I 
help, they rushed. Even when they came near the chariot Abhaya Kumar did not 
stop beating the man. When some of the people looked carefully and were about to 
ask questions the two in the chariot  started clapping and laughing. The masses 
 
NandiSootra 
 
Aagam- 44 -NandiSootra 
~ 84 ~ 
Compiled by- Deepratnasagar 
 
realised that the man being beaten was not their king but some impostor. They also 
laughed and dispersed. 
Every day Abhaya Kumar repeated this act at different hours during the day. 
For almost everyone in the city this act became so common that they stopped paying 
attention to it. So much so that even the guards laughed from a distance when they 
saw the chariot and heard the sounds of wailing and shouting. 
When Abhaya Kumar was confident that there was no one to stop or check 
him, finding an opportune moment one evening he caught king Chandpradyot and 
tied his limbs. Putting the prisoner in ai chariot, Abhaya Kumar drove through the 
streets of Ujjaini, continuously beating the prisoner with a stick. Chandpradyot kept 
shouting non-stop. The citizens heard these shouts from a distance and considering 
it to be Abhaya Kumar's play, laughed and turned away. No one came forward to the 
rescue of their real king. This time 1, Abhaya Kumar did not return back from the city 
gate. As soon as the 5 chariot was out of Ujjaini he increased its speed and moved 
towards Rajagriha. 
Abhaya Kumar brought his prisoner before king Shrenik and 5 narrated his 
story. Chandpradyot felt ashamed and repentant. He S begged Shrenik's pardon and 
the two royal relatives embraced each other. All present hailed Abhaya Kumar's wit 
and wisdom. 
2. The merchant - Disturbed with the questionable character of S his wife, a 
merchant got initiated as an ascetic. Yeai-•s later his able son became the king of 
that state. After this, once during his wanderings, the ascetic happened to come to 
the same town. The king requested his ascetic father to spend his monsoon stay in 
the town and he accepted. The discourses of the scholarly ascetic highly impressed 
the masses. Some people belonging to other religious sects!’Could not tolerate this 
and they framed a conspiracy to defame the ascetic. 
When the monsoon stay came to an end and the ascetic started preparing to 
depart, according to the plan of opponents, a pregnant maid came to the ascetic and 
said - ""0 ascetics, I am pregnant and will give birth to your child soon. At such a time 
if you depart leaving me alone who will look after me?"" 
The ascetic could understand that this was part of some conspiracy by 
someopponents. If he left in this situation it will be detrimental for him as well as the 
religious organisation. He was an accomplished spiritualist with unusual powers as 
well. He used his hidden power on the maid and said to her - ""If your pregnancy is by 
me you will have a timely delivery. But if it is not so, you will not be able to give birth 
to the child normally, it will have to be taken out by cutting open your stomach."" 
The maid was in her full months. She failed to give birth even when few days 
passed after the expected date. Slowly her pain increased. In this miserable 
condition her family members took her to the ascetic. Paying her homage to the 
ascetic she said moaning with pain - ""O great ascetic, joining the conspiracy fetched 
by your adversaries I put a false blame on you. I got the punishment for my deeds. 
Please forgive me and deliver me from this terrible pain."" 
The ascetic was simple and pure hearted. He at once pardoned the maid and 
withdrew his spell. The fame of the ascetic spread all around. 
3. The prince - A prince was very fond of modaks (laddu, ball shaped sweet) 
since his childhood. Once on some ceremonial occasion he got prepared very tasty 
food, of course, including modaks. When he took his meal with his friends, he could 
not control himself and ate much more modaks than he could digest. As a 
 
NandiSootra 
 
Aagam- 44 -NandiSootra 
~ 85 ~ 
Compiled by- Deepratnasagar 
 
consequence he had indigestion. The pain and stench due to indigestion became 
intolerable. In this condition he started thinking - ""Such tasty and fragrant things 
turned into stinking excreta as soon as they came in contact with the body. This body 
is made of filth and anything that comes in contact with the body ultimately turns into 
filth. Curse this body the pleasures of which inspire man to indulge in so much sin."" 
This feeling of revulsion for filth gradually transcended into pious attitude and 
finally leads to Kewal-jnana. It was the parinamiki buddhi that was instrumental in 
inspiring this turn of attitude. 
4. The goddess - In ancient times in a city named Pushpabhadra there was a 
king named Pushpaketu. The names of his wife, son and daughter were Pushpavati, 
Pushpachul and Pushpachula respectively. By the time the son and the daughter 
were young unfortunately queen Pushpavati died and she reincarnated as a 
goddess. 
As a goddess, when she saw her husband, son, daughter and other members 
of the family with the help of her Avadhilnana she thought if her daughter 
Pushpachula takes the spiritual path it will benefit her. With these thoughts she used 
her divine powers and vividly showed Pushpachula in her dream the horrifying 
scenes of agonising tortures of the hell. This dream infused a feeling of detachment 
in the mind of Pushpachula and renouncing the mundane pleasures she turned into 
an ascetic. As ascetic she strictly followed the ascetic code of conduct and indulged 
in harsh penance and deep meditation to destroy the vitiating karmas and attain 
Kewal-jnana. In the end getting liberated from the cycles of rebirth she attained 
moksha. The parinamiki buddhi of a goddess was instrumental in a soul's attaining 
the status of Siddha. 
5. Uditodaya - The name of the king of a city named Purimtal was Uditodaya. 
His queen's name was Shrikanta. The royal couple was very religious and lived 
happily following the codes of Shravak conduct. One day a parivrajika (a type of 
female mendicant) came to the palace and preached the religion based on physical 
cleansing. When the queen gave no heed to her preaching she got angry and left. 
Considering it to be her insult the parivrajika, in order to take revenge, went to king 
Dharmaruchi of Varanasi, praised the beauty of queen Shrikanta and instigated 
Dharmaruchi to get her. 
Dharmaruchi marched on Purimtal and laid a siege on the city. During the 
night king Uditodaya thought that if he fought a war there will be a horrible man 
slaughter and innumerable innocent lives will be lost for nothing. In order to find a 
way to avoid this terrible violence he decided to worship Vaishraman god and started 
a three day fast. As soon as the penance was over, Vaishraman godappeared. King 
Uditodaya told him about his problem and asked for some way to avoid the 
impending man slaughter. The god was impressed by the king's compassion and he 
at once moved the city to a distant area with his divine power. 
Next morning when king Dharmaruchi got up he was astonished to see that 
Purimtal city had disappeared from the area of siege. With disappointment he 
retreated and a terrible man slaughter was avoided. 
6. The monk and Nandisen - Emperor Shrenik of Rajagriha had a son 
named Nandishen. When he got matured king Shrenik married him to many beautiful 
and virtuous princesses. 
Wandering from one village to another, once Bhagavan Mahavir came to 
Rajagriha. King Shrenik went with his family to pay homage to Bhagavan Mahavir. 
 
NandiSootra 
 
Aagam- 44 -NandiSootra 
~ 86 ~ 
Compiled by- Deepratnasagar 
 
Nandishen and his wives were also in the group. When he listened to the discourse 
of Bhagavan Mahavir a feeling of detachment arose in him. After seeking permission 
from his parents he got initiated into the religious order. Intelligent Nandishen soon 
absorbed all the knowledge of Angas with the help of his teachers and started 
preaching to contribute to the spread of religion. A few days later he sought 
permission from Bhagavan Mahavir and left Rajagriha. 
For a long time he continued his itinerant way. One day ascetic Nandishen felt 
that one of his disciples was attracted towards mundane comforts. After due 
consideration he decided to go to Rajagriha. When king Shrenik was informed of his 
arrival he was much pleased and came to pay homage to the ascetic. All the, 
members of his family came with him and that included the former wives of ascetic 
Nandishen. 
When the wavering disciple of Nandishen saw the astonishingly beautiful 
former wives of his guru he got awakened and was filled with self reproach. He 
thought - ""My guru has become ascetic after renouncing royal grandeur and divinely 
beautiful wives, and is following the codes of conduct with absolute sincerity. And I 
am wavering under the attraction of ordinary mundane life, insignificant in 
comparison. Curse me, who is ready to eat again what I vomited. This deeply 
agitated state of mind inspired him to do atonement and be firm on the spiritual path. 
7. Dhanadatt - For the story of merchant Dhanadatt see chapter 18 of 
Illustrated Jnata Sutra, Part II. 
8. Shravak - Inspired towards religious life a man accepted the twelve vows 
of a shravak. One of the vows was to be content with his own wife. For many years 
he remained firm in his vows. However, once he happened to see a friend of his wife 
and got infatuated with her beauty. The desire to get that woman kept on increasing 
and his natural modesty did not allow him to reveal it. This disturbed state of mind 
had a telling effect on his health. His worried wife one day got to know the cause of 
his pain after much persuasion. 
She was very intelligent and patient. She quietly thought - ""If my husband 
continues to be tortured by these base thoughts he will one day lose his life. As a 
consequence of his despicable attitude he will have a bad rebirth. Therefore, I should 
do something so that he comes out of his present state of mind and regains the 
spiritual path."" With these thoughts she made a plan and accordingly said to her 
husband - ""My lord, I have talked to my friend. She will come to you tonight. But she 
belongs to a respectable family and feels shy to come openly in the light. Therefore 
she will come only when it is dark and return back before the dawn."" The shravak 
was relieved. 
The shravika, according to her, plan, went to her friend’s house and brought 
from her the dress and the ornaments she was wearing when she had last come to 
the former's house. In the darkness of the night she put on her friend's dress and 
ornaments and went to her husband. Before the dawn she returned to her room and 
changed to her normal dress. 
In the morning her husband got up and came to her. He was filled with deep 
remorse and started repenting - ""I have indulged in a despicable act. I have 
committed the great sin of breaking the vow Iaccepted."" When the wife saw that her 
husband was genuinely repenting she told him everything and reassured him. She 
also inspired him to once again be firm on his resolve of observing the vows of a 
shravak. The shravak underwent a change of heart. He went to his guru and after

due repentance took the vows once again. Endowed with parinamiki buddhi the 
shravika re-established her husband on the religious path. 
9. The minister - In ancient times a city named Kampilyapur had a king 
named Brahma. His queen Chulni one night saw dreams that augur the birth of a 
Chakravarti and in due course gave birth to a son. The prince was named 
Brahmadatt. King Brahma died when Brahmadatt was still an infant. At the time of 
his death King Brahma had given the responsibility of managing the affairs of the 
state to a friend Deerghaprishta, king of a neighbouring kingdom, till his son became 
major. After the death of King Brahma, Deerghaprishta and Chulni fell in love. King 
Brahma had a minister named Dhanu who was very able, wise and faithful. It was he 
who looked after the up bringing and education of the prince. When the prince 
matured, minister Dhanu discreetly told him about the illicit relationship between 
Deerghaprishta and Chulni and warned him about the impending danger to the 
kingdom. Brahmadatt was infuriated. But minister Dhanu advised him to resort to 
cunning rather than anger. 
In consultation of minister Dhanu, Brahmadatt first decided to warn his 
mother. One day he put a crow and a cuckoo in the same cage and took it to her 
mother. Showing the birds he said in anger filled voice - ""I will punish those who are 
found guilty of crossbreeding like these birds."" 
The queen was filled with fear and told everything to Deerghaprishta. He 
reassured her saying that she should not give heed to a child's comments. 
Some days later pointing at a beautiful female elephant of good breed and an 
ugly elephant cohabiting together Brahmadatt told both Chulni and Deerghaprishta - 
""If I find some one having such illicit and mismatching relationship I will punish them 
with death."" 
He once again gave similar warning showing a swan and a stork. 
After the third warning Deerghaprishta also became apprehensive. In order to 
remove this impediment to their lasciviousactivities Chulni and Deerghaprishta 
cooked up a conspiracy. They planned to secretly construct a beautiful house of 
shellac and send Brahmadatt to live in that house after his marriage. On the 
honeymoon night the house was to be set to fire burning the newly wedded couple. 
Blinded by her lust the queen also agreed to kill her own son. 
Minister Dhanu came to know of this plan through his spies. He went to 
Deerghaprishta and said - ""Sir, now that I have grown old and unfit to look after the 
affairs of the state, I want to spend rest of my life indulging in religious worship and 
charitable activities. Kindly grant me leave."" Thus, getting permission from 
Deerghaprishta he went outside the city. On the banks of the Ganges he raised a 
large tent and started devotional activities including singing of hymns. There only, he 
opened a house of charity. Under the cover of these activities he secretly started 
digging an underground tunnel that was to open inside the house of shellac under 
construction. 
A few days later when the house of shellac was ready, minister Dhanu's 
tunnel was also ready. Deerghaprishta and Chulni married Brahmadatt to the 
daughter of king Pushpachool. Minister Dhanu gave the responsibility of making all 
necessary arrangements for the comforts of the newly wedded couple to his son 
Vardhanu, who was now a minister. Vardhanu took the new couple to the house of 
shellac for their honeymoon. At midnight the spies of Deerghaprishta set the house 
to fire. When Brahmadatt saw the walls of his new palace melting, he rushed to

Vardhanu's room and said - ""Friend, the palace is on fire and its walls are melting."" 
Vardhanu reassured him - ""Friend, don't worry."" And he took the new couple to 
minister Dhanu's camp through the tunnel.Minister Dhanu explained the prince in 
details about the conspiracy of the queen and Deerghaprishta and advised 
Brahmadatt and Vardhanu to go to some safe place. The parinamiki buddhi of the 
minister saved the life of Brahmadatt. 
10. Kshapak - Once an elderly ascetic, who indulged in harsh austerities, was 
going with his disciple to seek alms. On the way back a frog was crushed to death 
under his feet. When the disciple saw this he requested his guru to do pratikraman 
(atonement).The ascetic did not pay any attention. At the time of the evening 
pratikraman (critical review) the disciple again reminded him foratonement. This time 
the ascetic got furious and rushed to hit the disciple. In darkness he did not find the 
disciple and instead collided with a pillar. 
He suffered a fatal head injury and died on the spot. As a result of his harsh 
austerities he reincarnated as a Jyotishk god. After completing his life-span as a god, 
as a result of the karmas acquired due to his intense passion, he took rebirth as a 
serpent with venomous vision. As a serpent he acquired jati-smaran-jnana and he 
recalled all about his earlier births. He was filled with deep remorse for his misdeeds 
and underwent a change of heart. With the apprehension that some one could die 
under the spell of his venomous vision, he stopped coming out of his hole. 
In a nearby kingdom a prince died of snake-bite. Driven by his sorrow and 
anger the king issued orders to search and kill all the snakes in the area. All the 
snake charmers in the state took to the task. One of the snake charmers arrived at 
the hole of this serpent and poured some potion in the hole. Tormented by the 
medicine, the serpent had to come out of the hole. Concerned about the deadly 
effect of his venomous vision even in his near fatal condition, the serpent started 
slithering backwards from the hole. The snake charmer was waiting outside. As the 
serpent slithered out he started cutting it into pieces. Till he died, the serpent kept on 
tolerating even this acute agony with equanimity. The acquisition of meritorious 
karmas resulted in his reincarnating as the son of the same king. He was named 
Naagdatt. 
Inheriting pious attitude from his earlier birth, even as a child Naagdatt got 
detached, renounced the mundane life and became an ascetic. Due to his unique 
virtues like modesty, simplicity, care for others and clemency he became an object of 
worship even for gods. His glory made other ascetics jealous of him. Due to the 
attitude inherited from his earlier birth, ascetic Naagdatt was ravenous. As he could 
not remain hungry for long he also could not observe fasts. 
One day when other ascetics were observing a fast he also tried to follow suit. 
But when he could not tolerate the pangs of hunger he went out to seek alms. 
According to the ascetic code, he showed what he had brought to other ascetics and 
sought there permission to eat. One ascetic spit in his food saying that he was a 
starving glutton. Naagdatt abounded in equanimity and clemency. Even this incident 
failed to make him angry or react sharply. Criticising his own weakness he started 
meditating. As a result of this extremely calm! Attitude the purity of his thoughts and 
feelings went on increasing and he acquired Kewaljnana there itself. Gods 
descended to; celebrate the occasion. When the ascetics present there witnessed; 
this miracle they gravely repented their misbehaviour. While doing i self-reproach 
they also transcended into deep meditation andacquired Kewal-jnana.

With the help of his parinamiki buddhi Naagdatt succeeded in maintaining 
hisequanimity even in adverse circumstances and in theend was able to benefit not 
only he but others as well.as others. 
11. The minister's son - The story of getting away of prince! Brahmadatt 
form the house of shellac with the help of the Parinamiki Buddhi of minister Dhanu 
has been given under the title - The Minister. This example narrates an incident 
following that. 
Vardhanu and prince Brahmadatt were walking ahead into thejungle when the 
prince got thirsty. Vardhanu left him sitting under a Tree and went in search of water. 
At the other end, when Deerghaprishta came to know that prince Brahmadatt had 
escaped i from the house of shellac unscathed, he sent his soldiers in all ! Directions 
in search of the prince. One group of these soldiers found Vardhanu who had gone 
in search of water. They caught him and inquired about the prince. Vardhanu 
shouted loudly - -""Soldiers! Leave me alone. I don't know where Brahmadatt is."" 
As soon as the prince heard this he understood that Vardhanu is shouting in 
order to give him a warning. The prince at once rode his Horse and stealthily left the 
place. The soldiers started beating Vardhanu without paying any attention to his 
shrieks. Clever Vardhanu suddenly became limp and fell on the ground. Considering 
him to be dead the soldiers proceeded ahead. 
After sometime, Vardhanu got up and left in search of the prince. Even after 
all hisefforts he could not find the prince, however he found two herbal -I, medicines - 
nirjeevani (which made one unconscious) and sanjeevanii (which made one regain 
consciousness). 
Disappointed, Vardhanu returned to the city. Outside the city he met a 
chandal who informed that the king had imprisoned all the members of his family. 
Vardhanu made a plan to get the members of his family released. He gave 
necessary instructions to the chandal in details and gave him the nirjeevani 
Medicine. The chandal went into the prison to meet the members of Vaiidhanu's 
family. He gave them the medicine and Vardhanu's message. All the family members 
applied the medicine over their eyes and lay unconscious and appeared dead. 
When the king got this news he called the chandal and asked him take all the 
dead bodies to the cremation ground and cremate them. Vardhanu's plan was a 
success. The chandal placed the bodies of Vardhanu's family members into a cart 
and took them to the cremation ground. As instructed by Vardhanu he placed the 
bodies carefully at a safe place. When he got the information, Vardhanu came there 
and applied the sanjeevani medicine over the eyes of the limp bodies. Soon they all 
regained consciousness. Vardhanu made proper arrangements for their security and 
again left in search of Brahmadatt. 
Deep in the jungle he traced the prince. After this, the two friends raised an 
army through their intelligence and courage and conquered many kingdoms. 
Brahmadatt also married many a princesses. Gradually he expanded his empire and 
after destroying Deerghaprishta became Chakravarti, the emperor of the six 
continents. 
12. Chanakya - The name of the king of Patliputra city was Nand. Once he 
got angry on a scholarly Brahman named Chanakya and exiled him from Patliputra. 
Chanakya dressed himself as a mendicant and started wandering from one place to 
another. One day he reached the Maurya state. While wandering in the city he saw 
that a man dressed as a warrior was sitting outside a house in gloom. Chanakya 
 
NandiSootra 
 
Aagam- 44 -NandiSootra 
~ 90 ~ 
Compiled by- Deepratnasagar 
 
sympathetically asked him the reason for his sadness. The warrior said - ""My wife is 
pregnant. She has this strange dohad (pregnancy-desire) of swallowing the moon. 
How can I fulfil this strange desire? Consequently she is getting weaker and weaker 
every passing day. I am afraid that this might end in her death."" Chanakya assured 
him that coming full moon night her desire will be fulfilled 
Finding a suitable place outside the town Chanakya raised a tent. In the roof 
of this pavilion, he made a hole of calculated size. During the first quarter of the full 
moon night Chanakya invited the Kshatriya with his wife. When the couple entered 
the tent, Chanakya placed a large flat plate filled with a transparent liquid before the 
pregnant women on a marked place on the ground where the moon would reflect 
through the hole in the tent in the plate. Some time later when the moon was in line 
with the plate and the hole, it became visible in the plate. Chanakya at once said - 
""Sister, now the moon has descended in the plate. Please carefully lift the plate and 
swallow it with the liquid."" 
The lady was pleased to see the reflection of the moon in the plate. She 
carefully picked up the plate and started drinking the liquid. In the mean time 
Chanakya drew a pre-arranged curtain over the hole with the help of a string. When 
the lady finished the liquid in the plate she put it back on the ground and saw that 
there was no moon in the plate. She was convinced that she had swallowed the 
moon. She beamed with joy. Slowly her health improved and in due course she gave 
birth to a brilliant child. The child was named Chandragupta. This same child grew 
into a valorous young man and with the help of Chanakya destroyed the Nand 
dynasty to become famous as Chandragupta Maurya, the Magadh Emperor. 
Chanakya was endowed with unlimited Parinamiki Buddhi. 
13. Sthulabhadra - Shaktal, the prime minister (महामंत्री) of the Nand king of 
Patliputra, was a very intelligent and clever person. He had two sons named 
Sthulabhadra and Shreyak, and seven daughters named Yaksha, Yakshadatta, 
Bhuta, Bhutadatta, Sena, Vena and Rena. All these sons and daughters of Shaktal 
were astonishingly sharp. Each of the seven daughters had a unique and sharp 
memory. The eldest daughter, Yaksha could remember verbatim anything told to her 
just once. The second daughter memorized when she heard a thing twice, the third 
when she heard thrice, and so on and the seventh when she heard seven times. 
In Patliputra also lived a learned but poor Brahman named Vararuchi. He 
wrote 108 new verses everyday in honour of king Nand and recited them in the 
king's assembly. After listening to the recital the king looked at his minister Shaktal 
for his opinion. If Shaktal approved, Vararuchi could be rewarded. Serious tempered 
Shaktal remained silent every time and Vararuchi returned empty handed. When' he 
reached home his wife taunted him that if he did not earn, how could she run the 
household. Dejected Vararuchi one day went to Shaktal's house and reported his 
sad story to Shaktal's wife. The lady assured him that she would persuade her hust 
ad to change his attitude 
During the night, after Shaktal returned home, his wife said - ""My Lord, 
Brahman Vararuchi recites 108 new verses everyday in honour of the king. Are they 
not good or just not to your liking? If you, in fact, like his work why don't you praise 
the poor Brahman and encourage his creativity?"" 
Shaktal replied - ""He is conceited."" The wife insisted - ""If just two words of 
praise may benefit a poor Brahman, what is the harm?"" Shaktal was silenced by 
these words from his wife.

Next day when Vararuchi recited his PRAISE in honour of the king, Shaktal 
recalled his wife's words and uttered involuntarily - ""Good!"" As if the king was waiting 
for this, he at once ordered for a reward of 108 gold coins to Vararuchi. This day 
Vararuchi returned to his house happy. 
After Vararuchi left, Shaktal told the king - ""Sir! You gave him gold coins for 
nothing. This man plagiarizes from old texts to recite inyour praise."" The king asked 
with surprise - ""Do you have any proof of this?"" Shaktal at once said - ""The verses 
he recites are the same as I hear my daughters recite every morning. If you so 
desire, I can prove this tomorrow in the assembly."" The king granted permission - 
""All right, call them to the assembly tomorrow."" 
Next morning Shaktal took all his seven daughters to the assembly. As usual, 
Vararuchi came and recited his new PRAISE. As soon as the recital concluded 
Shaktal gestured at his eldest daughter, Yaksha. She got up, stepped forward and 
repeated Vararuchi's poem verbatim. Now Shaktal gestured at his second daughter. 
By now she had listened to the poetry twice and memorized. She also stepped 
ahead and repeated the poem. This way, one after the other, all the seven daughters 
of Shaktal repeated Vararuchi's poetry. The king now believed what Shaktal had told 
him. He got angry and told Vararuchi never to come to the assembly again. 
Vararuchi could well understand that this was Shaktal's conspiracy. He 
resolved to take revenge from Shaktal. He cleverly fixed a wooden plank on the 
banks of the Ganges in such a way that its one end was submerged in water and the 
other was on the shore. If a little pressure was applied on a specific spot on the 
plank the submerged portion rose to the surface of water. He placed a bag full of 
gold coins on the submerged portion and sitting on the other end started singing 
hymns for goddess Ganga. When the hymns concluded he bowed down to pay 
homage to the goddess and furtively pressed the plank. At once the other end 
surfaced with the bag full of gold coins. People standing around saw all this and 
looked at Vararuchi in surprise. Vararuchi commented - ""What if the king does not 
reward me, mother Ganges does so."" 
The news spread in the town like wild fire. When the king came to know of 
thisastonishing incident he called and asked Shaktal about it. Shaktal said - ""It is 
better to see with one's own eyes before believing in hearsay. If you permit, come 
morning we may go and witness the miracle ourselves."" 
After giving this advice to the king, Shaktal returned to his residence and 
called one of his spies. He gave him instructions to goto the river bank in the evening 
and hides himself. Vararuchi will come to place the bag full of gold coins in the river. 
When Vararuchi returns back after doing so he should stealthily enter the river, pick 
up the bag, and bring it to Shaktal. The spy followed these instructions and brought 
Vararuchi's bag to Shaktal late in the night. 
In the morning Vararuchi proceeded as usual, but when he pressed the plank 
it surfaced without the bag of coins. Vararuchi looked around in surprise. Now 
Shaktal, who was standing there with the king, taunted - ""Learned Pundit? The bag 
you hid in the river during the night has reached me.""Vararuchi felt ashamed when 
he was exposed before this large crowd. He at once left, but his anger and animosity 
for Shaktal increased. He resolved to destroy Shaktal. A few days later he made his 
disciples memorize a verse and asked them to spread it around the town. It read - 
""People don't know what Shaktal is going to do. He will kill king Nand and put his son 
Shreyak on the throne.""

Vararuchi's disciples publicized so much that not only the public but the king 
was also convinced that indeed Shaktal had cooked up this conspiracy. One day 
when Shaktal offered his respects to the king, he turned his face with anger. Shaktal 
at once understood that the king was drawn into the trap of mistrust. 
Worried and contemplating, Shaktal returned home. He called his son 
Shreyak and said - ""Son! King Nand has been caught in the net of misinformation 
spread by Vararuchi. The fire of his anger will engulf not only me but the whole 
family and lead to our destruction. I have seriously thought over the problem and 
come to the conclusion that I will sacrifice myself in order to ensure a strong and 
secure future for my family. Tomorrow when I go to the king's assembly and bow 
down to greet the king I will put taalput-vish (a deadly poison) in my mouth. When 
the king turns his face with aversion you should draw out your sword and behead me 
with one blow. I will already be dead due to the poison and you will become a 
confidante of the king."" 
Next day Shreyak exactly followed his father's instructions. When Shaktal was 
beheaded the king was taken aback. He asked Shreyak - ""What is this, Shreyak? 
You have assassinated your own father.""Shreyak replied at once - ""Sir, how can 
your faithful servant tolerate a person you are angry with? He is no more needed on 
this earth, which you are averse even to look at. 
The king became a little sad at the death of his old minister, but at the same 
time he was highly impressed by the unique display of loyalty by Shreyak. He asked 
Shreyak - ""Now you should accept the post of prime minister, Shreyak."" 
Shreyak - ""Sir, I cannot be the prime minister while my elder brother 
Sthulabhadra is still there. For last twelve years he is living with courtesan Kosha. He 
should be summoned; he is the rightful incumbent to this post."" 
The king's messenger went and met Sthulabhadra at the residence of court-
esan Kosha and gave him all the news including the king's order. 
Sthulabhadra came to the assembly. The king pointed at the empty seat of 
thePrime minister and said - ""Sthulabhadra, your father, prime minister Shaktal has 
left for his heavenly abode. Now you should take this seat."" 
Sthulabhadra was lost into his reverie. He was filled with conflicting thoughts - 
a deep sorrow at the death of his father; offer of a high seat by the man who was the 
cause of his father's death; how can one believe a man with such wavering mind? 
And in the final reckoning this post and wealth all are ephemeral. What is the use of 
running after such transient things? 
The train of thoughts continued and Sthulabhadra ended up getting detached 
from mundane life. Begging leave of the king, Sthulabhadra went to acharya 
Sambhootivijaya and got initiated as an ascetic. The king appointed Shreyak as his 
prime minister. 
Ascetic Sthulabhadra commenced his itinerant ascetic life moving around with 
his acharya and immersed himself into pursuit of knowledge. After a lapse of a long 
period acharya Sambhootivijaya once again came to Patliputra for a monsoon stay. 
The acharya had three other brilliant disciples besides Sthulabhadra. The four 
disciples sought permission to spend the period of four months in solitude at places 
of their choice for the purpose of testing the level oftheir ascetic practices. One of 
them went to live inside the cave of a lion, another near the hole of a highly 
poisonous serpent, and still another on the parapet of a well. Sthuhbhadra selected 
the house of courtesan Kosha for his stay.

Kosha was filled with joy when she saw Sthulabhadra once again in her 
house. She made arrangements for his stay in her dance chamber and provided all 
comforts. Sthulabhadra commenced his spiritual practices. 
The efforts of evoking feelings of lust and excitement were at their best. She 
started all out efforts to divert attention of meditating Sthulabhadra using her beauty 
and art. Sthulabhadra was well aware of the transitory nature of the pleasures 
derived out of mundane indulgences. He also knew about the inevitable process of 
their ultimate conversion into a long chain of sorrows. 
In spite of the all out efforts by Kosha this practicer of the path of eternal bliss 
remained unmoved and unwavering. Instead, the tranquil radiations emanating from 
Sthulabhadra in the serene meditating posture finally cleansed Kosha's aberrations. 
Sthulabhadra gave sermon to Kosha and accepting the vows she became a 
shravika. 
At the end of the monsoon stay the four practicers returned to the guru and 
paid their respects one by one. In praise of the first three the acharya said - ""You 
have been successful in tough spiritual practices."" When Sthulabhadra bowed, the 
guru said in praise - ""You have accomplished a very high degree of spiritual 
perfection.""This special praise for Sthulabhadra made the other three jealous and 
they looked for an opportunity to prove themselves equal to Sthuhbhadra. 
That opportunity came at the beginning of the next monsoon stay. The 
disciple who had spent the last monsoon-stay in a lion's cave approached the 
acharya and sought permission to spend this monsoon stay in Kosha's chamber. 
Even after the acharya's refusal he was obstinate enough to go to Kosha who was 
considerate enough to give him permission to stay. In a few days the ascetic forgot 
all his vows and practices and got infatuated with the beauty and charm of Kosha. 
When he expressed his desire to Kosha she was sad. Kosha decided to bring him 
back to the right path and said - ""Great ascetic, 
I am a courtesan. Even to qualify to express your carnal desire for me you 
have to pay one hundred thousand gold coins to me."" 
When he heard this, the ascetic became thoughtful. He said - ""I am a 
mendicant who has renounced the world. I lon't have even a single penny with me."" 
Kosha said - ""The king of Nepal gives a gem studded shawl to every visiting 
mendicant. Its price is one hundred thousand gold coins. You may go to Nepal and 
bring that shawl for me."" 
A man consumed by lust forgets what is good or bad for him and is prepared 
to do anything. The ascetic forgot all about his discipline and practices and left for 
Nepal. After a lot of hardships and suffering he reached Nepal and got the shawl 
from him. On the way back some bandits deprived him of the shawl. 
He was still not free of his obsession. Not caring for the hardships, he once 
again returned to Nepal and begged another shawl from the king. This time he 
concealed the shawl in a hollow staff. Avoiding bandits and suffering all hardships 
when he at last reached Kosha he was extremely weak and emaciated. 
With the hope that his desire at last is going to be fulfilled, he handed over the 
shawl to Kosha. Kosha smiled at his emaciated body, wiped her feet with the shawl 
and threw it on a heap of trash. 
The perplexed ascetic uttered - ""What have you done Kosha? I brought this 
shawl for you after suffering so much pain and you have thrown it on a heap of 
trash?"" 
 
NandiSootra

Kosha said serenely - ""Great ascetic, I did all this to bring you back to the right 
path. You have strayed from your path. Indeed, the gem studded shawl is highly 
valuable, but the discipline acquired through practices is priceless. All the pleasure 
and grandeur in the world is insignificant before it. You had decided to throw away 
that self earned immense wealth on the heap of the trash that is carnal indulgence. 
Regain your rationality and try to understand why you have become eager to accept 
again what you abandoned considering it to be despicable and base?"" 
Kosha's statement opened the ascetic's eyes. He involuntarily uttered - 
""Sthulabhadra, who does harshest of the harsh spiritualpractices, is indeed, unique 
among ascetics. What gurudev had said is true."" 
Tortured by the pain of his fall, the thoughtful ascetic returned to his guru. He 
narrated the story of his downfall to his teacher and repented for and atoned his sins. 
Criticizing himself and praising Sthulabhadra he said - ""I bow before and offer my 
respect to ascetic Sthulabhadra who; in spite of all the enticements like an attracted 
and infatuated courtesan, rich food, attractive palace, healthy body, blooming youth 
and monsoon season, won over the god of love and put the courtesan on the 
spiritual path by his sermon."" 
Thus with the help of his Parinamiki Buddhi, Sthulabhadra abandoned the 
post of prime minister, mundane pleasures, wealth and grandeur to attain spiritual 
bliss. He is worthy of all praise. 
14. Sundarinand of Nasikpur - In Nasikpur lived a merchant named Nand. 
The name of his extremely beautiful wife was Sundari. The merchant was so 
infatuated with her that he would not let her away from his eyes even for a moment. 
Because of this deep attachment with his wife people started calling him 
Sundarinand. 
The merchant had a younger brother who got detached from the world and 
became an ascetic. When he came to know that his brother neglected everything 
due to his fondness for his wife, he came to Nasikpur to enlighten his brother. 
Getting the news of the ascetic's arrival all the townspeople came to attend the 
discourse but for Sundarinand. 
After the discourse the ascetic went out in search of food. Wandering around 
he arrived at his brother's house. When he saw the condition of his brother with his 
own eyes, he thought - ""As long as he is not drawn to something better he will not be 
free of his infatuation."" With this idea he created an ordinary woman with the help of 
his vathriyalabdhi (the special power to transform material things) and asked the 
merchant - ""Is she as beautiful as Sundari?"" 
The merchant replied - ""No, she is not even half as beautiful as Sundari."" 
Now the ascetic created a lower goddess and asked - ""How about this?"" 
Merchant - ""Yes, she is like Sundari."" 
Third time the ascetic created a goddess and repeated the same question.. 
This time the merchant was impressed - ""Indeed! She is more beautiful than 
Sundari.""Now the ascetic conveyed his message– 
""If you indulge even a little bit in religious activities, you 'will get many such 
beautiful women without any special effort."" 
These words opened the merchant's eyes. He could now grasp the basic 
purpose behind the ascetic's antics. His attitude underwent a change and gradually 
his infatuation for his wife reduced. Later he became an ascetic and stepped on the 
path of purification of the soul.

The ascetic applied his parinamiki buddhi and freed his brother from carnal 
attachments. 
15. Vajra Swami - In the Avanti state there was a town named Tumbavan. 
There lived a young merchant named Dhan-giri who was married to Sunanda, the 
daughter of merchant Dhanpal. Dhangiri had a desire to become an ascetic, but 
somehow Sunanda dissuaded him from doing so. Sometime litter Sunanda became 
pregnant and a pious soul descended into her womb. 
When Dhangiri became aware of this he said - ""Now you will be able to spend 
your life with the support of the son you expect. Please don't block my spiritual 
progress."" 
Sunanda had to yield before such strong inclination of her husband to 
renounce the world. She gave her consent to Dhangiri to become an ascetic. 
Dhangiri went to acharya Simhagiri and got initiated. Sunanda's brother, Arya Samit 
was also an ascetic disciple of acharya Simhagiri. Soon after this event, acharya 
Simhagiri left Tumbavan and resumed his itinerant way. 
In due course Sunanda gave birth to a brilliant son. When his birth was 
celebrated a lady looked at him and uttered - ""How good it would be if the father of 
this child was with him instead of being an ascetic."" 
When these words entered the ears of the infant he acquired Jati-smaran 
jnana. He thought - ""My father has accepted the path of spiritual uplift. I should also 
do something so that I also get free of the worldly ties and my mother also takes to 
the path of liberation."" These thoughts inspired him to start crying day and night. To 
make him stop crying his mother and other relatives made all possibleefforts but in 
vain. In the end Sunanda got irritated with this continuous crying of the child. 
Coincidentally just a few days later acharya Simhagiri once again arrived at 
Tumbavan with his disciples. Arya Samit and Dhangiri prepared to proceed for alms 
collection in the town. When they sought permission from the acharya, he saw the 
auspicious signs and commented - ""A great boon awaits you. Bring whatever you get 
as alms."" 
Searching for food, when the two ascetics arrived at Sunanda's house, she 
was trying to stop her infant son from crying. Ascetic Dhangiri extended his (झोली) 
alms pot. Seeing this, Sunanda was struck with an idea. She at once put the infant in 
the pot and said - ""Revered one, now you look after your son. I am fed up."" The 
onlookers looked agape. The ascetic accepted the alms in presence of all these 
people, put the pot in his alms bag and left without a word. Every one present was 
surprised when the child stopped crying as soon as the ascetic turned to leave. 
When the ascetics arrived before acharya Simhagiri and he saw the unusually 
heavy alms bag, he commented - ""What is this vajra (hard and heavy rock) like thing 
you got as alms."" Dhangiri brought out the pot with the infant and placed it before his 
guru. The acharya was pleasantly surprised to see the radiant child and said - ""This 
boy will be a boon to the Jain organization. I name him Vajra."" 
The child was very young; therefore the responsibility of his care was given to 
the sangh. As child Vajra grew so grew his talent and brilliance. After sometime had 
passed, Sunanda sought her child back from the sangh. The elders of the sangh 
refused on the ground that the boy belonged to some other person. Sunanda 
returned dejected and started waiting for some opportunity. At last the opportunity 
came her way when acharya Simhagiri once again came to Tumbavan. As soon as 
Sunanda got the news of his arrival she went to the acharya and asked him to return

her son. When the acharya also refused, she approached the king with a heavy 
heart. The king listened to her complaint and after careful consideration issued 
instructions - ""On one side should sit the mother and on the other the ascetic father. 
The child should be left on his own. To whichever of the two the child goes, will be 
considered the rightful guardian of the child."" 
Next day all necessary arrangements were made in the court. Sunanda sat on 
one side with numerous attractive toys and also some eatables to entice the child. 
Showing these things to the child sitting at the center of the assembly she gestured 
the child to come to her. 
The child thought - ""Only when I do not go to my mother will she be inspired to 
detach herself from her love for me and proceed on the spiritual path. This will 
benefit us both."" With these thoughts he did not move from where he was sitting. 
Now his father, ascetic Dhangiri, addressed him - ""O Vajra, if you are firm in 
your resolution, accept this rajoharan (special broom carried by Jain ascetics), the 
symbol of spiritual practice and remover of the sand of karma."" 
Hearing these words child Vajra at once went to his father and picked the 
rajoharan up. The king, who witnessed all this, immediately gave the child to acharya 
Simhagiri. After seeking permission from the sangh and the king, acharya Simhagiri 
formally initiated him as an ascetic. 
Sunanda also got detached. She thought - ""When my brother, husband and 
son all have broken all worldly ties and become ascetics, what will I do in my house 
all alone?"" She also got initiated and accepted the spiritual path. 
In due course acharya Simhagiri left the town with his disciples. Ascetic Vajra 
was highly talented. When the acharya read the scriptures to his disciples, Vajra 
listened very attentively. Just by hearing this way he gradually acquired complete 
knowledge of the eleven Angas. 
One day the acharya had gone out of the upashraya. Other ascetics were 
also away for alms collection. Child ascetic Vajra playfully arranged the clothes of 
ascetics in a row and he himself sat in the middle facing the row. Considering the 
heaps of clothes to be his disciple he started giving discourse of the Angas to them. 
When the acharya was returning into the upashraya he heard the sound of 
reading of the Angas. As he approached nearer he could recognize the voice of 
ascetic Vajra. He was astonished at the perfect style of reading and the 
unprecedented knowledge of the child. Cherishing the perfection of reading he 
arrived near ascetic Vajra. The child ascetic got up and greeted him humbly and 
respectfully. He then replaced all the belongings of the ascetics at their proper 
places. 
Some day’s later acharya Simhagiri left for other places for some days. While 
leaving he gave the responsibility of giving reading of the Angas to ascetic Vajra. 
The child ascetic explained evens the most subtle and difficult topics from Agams in 
such a simple and easily understandable style that even comparatively dull ascetics 
faced hardly any difficulty in grasping the meaning. With the help of the detailed 
explanations of the scriptures he even removed doubts of the ascetics in their 
previously learned lessons. All the ascetics developed a very high degree of respect 
for him and they continued to get their lessons from him with due modesty. 
When acharya Simhagiri returned, the ascetics requested - ""Gurudev, ascetic 
Vajra's style of giving lessons of the Agams is extremely good. Please entrust him 
with this responsibility permanently."" The acharya was happy and contented to hear 
 
NandiSootra 
 
Aagam- 44 -NandiSootra

Compiled by- Deepratnasagar 
 
this. He said - ""I am pleased to know about the feelings of goodwill and affection for 
ascetic Vajra. Only to acquaint you with his ability and expertise I had given this task 
to him and left on my tour."" And then, realizing that without formally getting 
knowledge from a guru no one can be appointed a teacher of the Agams, acharya 
Simhagiri himself gave all his knowledge to ascetic Vajra. 
During his wanderings from one village to other, acharya Simhagiri once 
came to Dashpur city. At that time acharya Bhadragupta, due to his old age, had 
abandoned his itinerant way and was residing permanently in Avanti city. Acharya 
Simhagiri sent ascetic Vajra and two, other disciples for studies under acharya 
Bhadragupta. With all humbleness ascetic Vajra served his new guru and acquired 
the knowledge of ten Purvas. When acharya Simhagiri found that his end was near 
he installed ascetic Vajra to the position of acharya. 
Acharya Vajra wandered around a large area for a long time and with the help 
of his impressive personality, endless scriptural knowledge and many special 
powers, worked successfully for an extensive spread of religion. All this became 
possible with the help of his parinamiki buddhi. 
16. Charanahat (The kicked one) - In a city ruled a young king. Considering 
him to be immature, some young individuals came to him and in order to gain 
favours, advised him - ""Sir, you are young, therefore you should appoint only young 
men to direct the affairs oi the state. Being energetic and able, such persons will 
successfully handle the administration."" The elderly persons can hardly do anyE 
thing efficiently and properly due to their physical weakness."" 
Although the king was young, he was very intelligent. In order tch test the 
wisdom of these young people he put before them aE question - ""How should I 
punish someone who kicks at my head with his feet?"" 
The young people were ready with a reply - ""He should be cut toy pieces."" 
Now the king put the same question before his elderly andE experienced 
ministers, they pondered over the question and replied - ""Sir, you should shower 
your affection and gifts on him."" 
The young men turned red with anger. The king pacified them and asked the 
ministers to explain their statement. One of the elderly ministers stood up and said - 
""Sir, who else but your infant son can possibly kick you in your head? The playful 
activities of an infant prince are rewarded with love and gifts, not punishment."" 
This explanation from the elders made the youth ashamed at their ignorance. 
The happy king rewarded the elderly ministers. He said to the young men - ""In the 
affairs of the state energy is not the only requirement; intelligence and experience 
are also needed."" The elders satisfied the king with their parinamtki buddhi. 
17. Anvala - A potter made an anvala (a citrus fruit) with yellow sand. 
Considering a person to be ignorant, he tried to sell the anvala and gave it in his 
hand. Taking the fruit in his hand the man thought - ""It looks to be anvala but it is 
very hard. And this is not the season for this fruit."" With the help of his parinamiki 
buddhi he understood that it was just a model. He threw it on the ground and was not 
caught in the trap. 
18. The Bead - In a jungle lived a gem bearing snake. During the night it 
slithered up a tree and fed on the chics of birds. Once when it was slithering up the 
tree it lost balance and fell from the tree. During this fall its gem got stuck into the 
branches of the tree. Exactly under the tree was a well. Due to the radiant reflection 
of the gem the water in the well started appearing red. In the morning a boy came 
 
NandiSootra 
 
Aagam- 44 -NandiSootra 
~ 98 ~ 
Compiled by- Deepratnasagar 
 
there while playing around. With curiosity he looked into the well and found the water 
red. When he returned home he told his father about a well with red water and 
brought along his father to show the strange water. The father was experienced and 
was endowed with parinamiki buddhi. Wen he looked into the well, he at once 
understood that the red color of the water was just due to the reflection of some 
shining red thing. He climbed the tree and after searching found the radiant gem and 
brought it home. 
19. The serpent - After his first monsoon stay at Asthik village Shraman 
Bhaga van Mahavir left for Shvetambika city. On the way were South Vachal and 
North Vachal areas. There were two ways to! reach North Vachal; one was 
roundabout and the other, passing through the Kanak Khal Ashram. This hermitage 
was once full ofgreenery but desolate now. Mahavir chose this forlorn and difficult 
path. 
When he was about to step on that path, some cowherds shouted - ""0 
ascetics! Stop. Do not go that way. It is a dangerous trail. There is a terrible black 
serpent that has poison in its eyes. Its poisonous hissing destroys even plants. Take 
the other trail not this."" 
Mahavir heard this panicky call of the cowherds but with a smile he raised his 
open palm in assurance and stepped ahead. Walking firmly he arrived near the 
snake-hole. Close to the snake-hole was a dilapidated temple. Mahavir stood in 
meditation in the kayotsarga posture in the shade of this temple. 
After sometime the giant black serpent came out of its hole hissing fiercely. 
Ithad set its eyes on a human being after a long time. The man was standing firm 
and fearless with closed eyes. The serpent was surprised. It looked at Mahavir with 
its poisonous red eyes. Like flames from a ball of fire its poisonous eyes emitted 
waves of venom. It hissed awesomely, but all this had no effect on Mahavir. Many a 
times it attacked Mahavir with its poisonous gaze but Mahavir was still unmoved. 
This failure infuriated the serpent. Slithering ahead it sank its fangs in 
Mahavir's toe and injected all the venom. Even this had no effect on Mahavir. This 
added fuel to the fire and the serpent bit Mahavir twice again. Even this was wasted. 
Suddenly the serpent saw that from the spots where it had bitten, instead of blood, 
milk was oozing out. 
Confused by his failure, the serpent was lost in its thoughts. Fear replaced its 
anger. Mahavir decided that it was time to preach the serpent. He uttered in his deep 
and serene voice - ""O Chandakaushik, open your inner eyes. Be calm and 
remember your past life. Rise above the anger."" 
When the serpent met Mahavir's gaze it felt as if a wave of peace had 
engulfed it. It was lost deep in its thoughts. The address - Chandakaushik appeared 
to be known to him. It entered the state of Jati-smaran jnana. Incidents of its past 
births surfaced– 
Two births before he was a shraman ascetic. He used to do month long fasts 
and eat only dry food. Once he was going to collect alms forhis breakfast. A disciple 
was following him. A small frog got crushed under his feet and he was unaware of 
this. The disciple saw this and humbly said - ""Master, it seems that a frog has been 
crushed under your feet inadvertently. Please do atonement."" He found the comment 
unpleasant and reprimanded the disciple. 
The disciple remained silent, thinking that he should not have passed any 
comment while walking. They returned to their place of stay. In the evening when it 
 
NandiSootra 
 
Aagam- 44 -NandiSootra 
~ 99 ~ 
Compiled by- Deepratnasagar 
 
was time for doing pratikraman, considering it to be the proper time, the disciple 
once again conveyed his advice. The guru turned mad with anger and rushed to hit 
the disciple. It was dark in the upashraya. The guru collided with a pillar and fell. His 
skull was fractured and he died on the spot. As he died with anger filled attitude he 
reincarnated as a Jyotishk god. 
Completing his life-span as a god he reincarnated as the son of the rector of 
the Kanak Khal hermitage. He was named Kaushik. As he was extremely angry by 
nature, every one started calling him Chandakaushik. Once some boys from 
Shvetambi city came to visit the hermitage garden. While roaming around they 
started plucking the colourful and pretty flowers. Chandakaushik warned them not to 
do so but, as they belonged to the royal family, they did not care for what he said. 
They even misbehaved with Chandakaushik. He got infuriated, picked up an axe and 
ran after the boys. The quick and agile boys evaded him and ran away. 
Chandakaushik chased them but slipped and fell into a ditch. He was injured by the 
axe and bled to death. Due to extreme anger at the time of death he reincarnated as 
a giant serpent with venomous gaze. 
The incidents of last two births flashed in the memory of the serpent and it 
realized about the consequences of extreme anger. The feeling of repentance 
melted its heart. Its inner self became awake. Its mind became tranquil. It touched 
the pious feet of Bhagavan Mahavir and resolved silently - ""Prabhu, since this 
moment I will ' never look at anyone all my life. I will not eat anything. I will not drink 
also."" And the now peaceful serpent put its mouth in the hole and lay still. 
Next day the cowherds looked curiously from a distance. They saw the 
greatshraman standing in meditation near the snake-hole. Slowly they came near 
and saw that the serpent was laying nearbywith its mouth in the hole. A crowd 
gathered. When some of them started throwing stones and pieces of wood, the 
elders said - ""No, this is a serpent god. Do not kill but worship."" People started 
worshipping the snake god by offering milk and sweets. The serpent tolerated all this 
and remained immobile. Swarms of ants were attracted by the smell of sweets and 
milk. They started stinging the serpent. With the resolve to cleanse its soul of the 
sins of the earlier births, the serpent tolerated all these afflictions with equanimity for 
fifteen days. By then his body was almost completely perforated and it died. 
Chandakaushik reincarnated as a god in the Sahasrar Kalp. With the help of 
parinamiki buddhi the serpent got an excellent rebirth. 
20. The rhinocerous - After listening to the sermons of ascetics a man 
accepted the shravak vows but could not properly observe !L them. Later he fell sick 
and died before atoning for the sins. As a consequence of this fall from the religious 
conduct he reincarnated as a rhinocerous in a jungle. Because of his cruel nature it 
killed other animals in the jungle. If any human being happened to come into that 
jungle it killed them as well. 
Once some ascetics were passing through that jungle. The moment the rhino 
saw them it rushed to kill. The aura of their! Penance and attitude of ahimsa did not 
allow him to reach them.  Failure in his desired act forced him to think about the 
reasons of this weakness. Gradually his anger was pacified. As a consequence of 
destruction and suppression of the knowledge veiling karmas he acquired Jati-
smaran jnana. Knowing about his earlier birth he was filled with self reproach. He 
started repenting, resolved to fast till death and indulged in pious thoughts. When he

died he reincarnated as a god. With the help of parinamiki buddhi the rhino 
recovered from his fall. 
21. Breaking of the dome - Princes Kunik and Vihalla wereamong the sons 
of king Shrenik. During his life time king Shrenikhad given the Sechanak elephant 
and Vankchud necklace to Vihalla, and Kunik had become the king of Magadh. 
Vihalla used to go every day to the banks of the Ganges with hiswives, riding 
Sechanak elephant. The elephant playfully lifted thequeens with its trunk and 
entertained them. The public praisedVihalla and his queens and commented that it 
was Vihalla who trulyenjoyed the royal wealth. 
King Kunik's wife, queen Padmavati, burned with jealousy whenshe heard all 
this. She said to her husband - ""As long as I do not ownSechanak elephant and 
Vankchud necklace, I am queen only fornamesake. You should get these for me."" At 
first Kunik did not payany attention. But with continued nagging from his wife him at 
lastagreed to get them for her. 
He asked Vihalla to give the two things. Vihalla replied - ""If you want to have 
the two things you will have toshare your kingdom with me."" Kunik was not prepared 
for this therefore he decided to use force. When Vihalla came to know of this he took 
his family, the necklace and Sechanak elephant and went to his maternal grand 
father, king Cheda (Chetak) in Vaishali city. 
This act of Vihalla infuriated king Kunik. He sent a messenger to king Cheda 
with a message - ""All the best things in a state rightfully belong to the king. Therefore 
please arrange to return prince Vihalla and his family with Sechanak elephant and 
Vankchud necklace. If not, be prepared to face war."" 
King Chetak was not some minor ruler. He was also a great warrior 
andfavoured justice. He sent his reply with the same messenger - ""As Kunik is my 
grandson so is Vihalla. King Shrenik had given these two things to Vihalla during 
hislife time. Therefore, they rightfully belong to him. Still, if Kunik wants these things 
he will have to give half his kingdom to Vihalla. If he disagrees and wants a war I am 
ready."" 
The messenger repeated the words of king Cheda before Kunik whose anger 
saw no bounds. He at once marched for Vaishali with his large army and brothers 
including Kaal Kumar. King Cheda also, with his associate kings and many heads of 
republics, marched towards the battle field to face Kunik.The two armies clashed and 
in the ensuing battle hundreds of thousands died. King Cheda was defeated in this 
war. With his remaining army he retreated into the fortified Vaishali city and closed 
all the gates in the immense city wall. Kunik tried to breach the wall at many places 
to enter the city but did not succeed, during these efforts one day there was a divine 
pronouncement - ""When ascetic Koolbalak is beguiled by courtesan Magadhika and 
tells the way to breach the walls Kunik should follow the method and then only he 
can conquer Vaishali."" 
Kunik was astonished at this divine pronouncement. Still, he believed it and 
ordered for the search of courtesan Magadhika. His spies soon traced Magadhika's 
whereabouts. When the courtesan came, the king explained her plan. According to 
the king's order she at once went in search of ascetic Koolbalak. 
Koolbalak was an extremely short tempered and evil ascetic. When he lived 
with his guru he always misinterpreted what his guru said and quarrelled with him. 
One day he was going along with his guru on a hilly track when he got angry with his 
guru on some point. At once, in order to kill his guru, he pushed a large rock from 
 
NandiSootra 
 
Aagam- 44 -NandiSootra 
~ 101 ~ 
Compiled by- Deepratnasagar 
 
behind the old man. When the guru saw the boulder coming at him he evaded it and 
saved himself. This despicable act of the disciple angered the guru and he cursed 
and cast a spell - ""Scoundrel! You are so mean that you can resort to killing some 
one. Go! I curse you that a woman will be the cause of your downfall."" 
It was the second nature of Koolvalak to go against the words of his guru and 
try to prove him wrong. In order to prove even these words of the guru wrong, he 
went at a desolate place and started meditation on the banks of a river. He did not 
even go into the village to beg food. He lived on any food provided by any passerby, 
if at all there was such an opportunity. Once the river was in spate. Koolbalak was 
afraid that he would be swept away. But the effect of his harsh penance was such 
that the river changed its bed on its own. It was this astonishing event that gave him 
his popular name Koolvalak. 
First of all Magadhika found out about the place where Koolvalak lived. After 
that she disguised herself as a shravika and started living near the river. She 
impressed Koolvalak with her devotion and services and requested him to accept 
food from her. When the ascetic came to her cottage for food she mixed some strong 
purgative in the food and served. The ascetic got acute dysentery. During his 
sickness the courtesan nursed him. With constant touch of the female body the 
ascetic was drawn towards her. Finding him in a mental state that suited her purpose 
Magadhika brought him to king Kunik. 
Kunik first pleased the ascetic with his devout behaviour and then asked - 
""Great ascetic, please show me the way to breach this immense and surrounding 
wall around Vaishali."" 
Koolvalak thought for sometime and then rephed - ""King, I will disguise my-
self as an augur and enter the city. At the proper time I will give a message by furling 
a white flag from the parpetAs soon as you see this flag you should retreat a short 
dis-tance with your army. This will infuse confidence for me in the minds of the 
citizens. 
After Kunik agreed, Koolbalak disguised himself as an augur and easily 
entered the city. Seeing an augur the prominent citizens of Vaishali approached him 
and asked - ""Sir, king Kunik has surrounded our city. Please tell us how to come out 
of this predicament."" Koolbalak, with the help of his special powers and knowledge, 
already knew that the stupa (a dome shaped religious structure) at the center of the 
city cast a protective shield on the walls. 
The moment the stupa was demolished the wall could be breached easily. As 
such, he said to the citizens of Vaishali deceitfully - ""Brothers, the stupa at the center 
of city is root cause of this problem. As long as that stupa is not demolished you can 
not be freed from this trouble. When you demolish it Kunik will retreat on his own."" 
The simple and ignorant citizens were caught in the ascetics trap. They 
started demolishing the stupa. Getting this work started Koolvalak went to the 
parapet on some pretext and raised a white flag. Following the plan Kunik started 
retreating with his army. When the citizens saw this, they believed what the augur 
had said and resumed the demolition work with renewed enthusiasm. Soon the 
stupa was completely demolished and with it ended the divine protection. Kunik was 
waiting for this moment. He at once launched his attack and breaking the fortification 
conquered Vaishali. The courtesan used her partnamiki buddhi to cause the downfall 
of the ascetic and Koolvalak misused his partnamiki buddhi to demolish the stupa. 
This concludes the description of ashrut nishrit mati jnana.

SHRUT NISHRIT MATI-JNANA 
[111] MEANING -Question - What is this shrut nishrit mati-jnana? 
Answer - Shrut nishrit mati-jnana is said to be of fourtypes - (1) Avagraha, (2) 
Iha, (3) Avaya, and (4) Dharana. 
COMMENTARY -Avagrah - In Jain Agams there are said to be two types of 
upayog (indulgence) - with form and formless. These two have also been called 
darshanopayog (indulgence in perception) and jnanopayog (indulgence in 
knowledge). Darshanopayog precedes jnanopayog; that is why it has also been 
mentioned here. To generally know about the existence of a thing through its 
required partial contact with sense organs and mind is called darshan or perception. 
Immediately after this is born the knowledge that understands the thing more 
specifically, recognizing if it is human, matter or something else. This is called 
auagrah. In simpler terms the simple knowledge devoid of any specific adjectives or 
other concepts is called avagrah. 
Iha - The effort, by way of analyzing the perceived information, to intelligently 
know the subject that follows avagrah andprecedes avaya is called iha. Generally 
speaking, the desire to know the superficially perceived subject during avagrah, in 
greater detail is called iha. During avagrah reality and unreality or true and false both 
are received. The process of analyzing that information reject the unreal and accept 
the real is accomplished by iha. 
Avaya - The decision arrived at through the activity of iha is called avaya. 
Decision and certainty are other names of avaya. This means that the decisive or 
certain knowledge is called avaya. 
Dharana - To accept or absorb, into the mind or the memory, the so decided 
meaning is called dharana. A decision stays only momentarily. It vanishes the 
moment the attention is diverted or the subject is changed. But it sticks into the 
memory as sarnshar (attitude, here the key that activates the specific memory) and 
surfaces when it is triggered by some coincidence. Such reality, firmly established 
into memory is also known as dharana. There are said to be three levels of dharana- 
Avichyuti - Not to be diverted from the indulgence directed to avaya. In other 
words to be firm on the decision arrived at by iha. The maximum duration of this 
undivided dharana is antarmuhurt. Any indulgence of a chhadmasth does not stick to 
one subject for more than antarmuhurt. 
Vasana - When the knowledge acquired in the state of avichyuti is fixed into 
the memory as samskar it is called vasana. When to be firm or to be decisive 
becomes a habit it may be called vasana. These samskars may last for countable or 
uncountable period. 
Smriti - After vasana is acquired, by seeing an object or by some other 
coincidence the knowledge surfacing as a consequence of 'profound samskar is 
known as smriti. 
These four categories of shrut nishrit mati-jnana occur essentially in this 
sequence. Which means that first of all avagrah comes into play, then iha, after iha 
comes avaya and after avaya comes dharana. This sequence is inter-related. 
✻AVAGRAH✻ 
[112] MEANING -Question - What is this avagrah? 
 
Answer - Avagrah is said to be of two types –  
                       - (1) Arthavagrah and (2) Vyanjanavagrah. 
 
NandiSootra 
 
Aagam- 44 -NandiSootra

COMMENTARY -Arth means a thing or a substance and vyanjan means 
variations or properties (a specific state of drauya). Although here first arthavagrah is 
mentioned and then uyanjanavagrah but they occur in the reverse order. First comes 
vyanjanavagrah and then arthavagrah. 
Vyanjan means that which is the means of expression, or that which is 
expressed. And this expression is perceived by the physical and mental sense 
organs. The physical sense organs are acquired by fruition of the angopang-nam-
karma (the karma that is responsible for the major and minor parts of the body) 
related to Audarik, Vaikriya and Aharak bodies. The mental sense organs are 
acquired by the kshayopasham of knowledge veiling and perception veiling karmas. 
Also these both are interdependent. Beings can acquire knowledge in proportion of 
the number of sense organs they have. 
For example a one sensed being can receive (avagrah) knowledge only 
through touch, whereas a five sensed being can do so though all the five senses. 
This vyanjanavagrah comes immediately after darshanopayog (indulgence in 
perception). This process is slow and natural and does not require any preceding 
practice. It occurs when the intensity of kshayopasham is low. Its duration is 
uncountable units of samaya. It has three divisions - (1) Upakaranendriya (physical 
sense organ), (2) The /union of the sense organ with its subject, and (3) The 
resultant information expressed as sound, word etc. 
When vyanjanavagrah is complete then comes arthavagrah. When vyanjan-
avagrah receives the variations and attributes, then based on this information cis 
born a superficial but comparatively complete knowledge about that specific thing or 
subject. As compared to vyanjanavagrah, arthavagrah is faster, it requires practice, 
and there is a comparatively higher degree of kshayopasham. 
Although knowledge cannot be acquired only with the help of vyanjanavagrah, 
but as at its conclusion comes arthavagrah, which is a form of knowledge, it certainly 
is a means of knowledge. That is why; causally it is accepted as knowledge. If there 
is a total absence of knowledge in vyanjanavagrah how on maturing could it turn into 
arthavagrah which is knowledge? Therefore it can be inferred that no matter how 
infinitesimal it is, there certainly is a fraction of knowledge existing in 
vyanjanavagrah. However, as it is infinitesimal it is not expressible. 
FOUR CATEGORIES OF VYANJANAVAGRAH 
[113] MEANING -Question - Of how many types is this vyanjanavagrah? 
Answer - Vyanjanavagrah is said to be of of four types - (1) Shrotrendriya 
vyanjanavagrah, (2) Ghranendriya vyanjanavagrah, (3) Jihvendriya vyanjanavagrah 
and (4) Sparshanendriya vyanjanavagrah. 
COMMENTARY -The process of vyanjanavagrah has been explained here. 
As long as there is no intimate contact of tongue with the object of taste it cannot 
receive the experience of taste. Taste is received or experienced only when the ras 
(the particles that are responsible for imparting taste) are in direct and intimate 
contact with tongue. The same is true for the sense organs of touch and smell. The 
sense organ of hearing (Shrotrendriya) does not require such intimate and direct 
contact. It accomplishes the reception through simple or a mere fleeting touch. 
These four sense organs are called receptive sense organs. The conveyance of 
information to these sense organs by the thing or subject is through mutual contact. 
As against this, mind and eyes receive information of their subject from a 
distance. The eyes cannot see any particles that are directly touching it but can see 
 
NandiSootra

everything which is away from them. The mind also cannot know things coming in 
close contact with it, like the inner organs of the body, but can know things stationed 
away from it. That is why these two organs are called the non-receptive sense 
organs. The conveyance of information to these two by the thing or subject is not 
through mutual contact. 
SIX CATEGORIES OF ARTHAVAGRAH 
[114] MEANING -Question - What are the types of this arthavagrah? 
Answer - Arthavagrah is said to be of six types - (1) Shrotrendriyaarthavagrah, 
(2) 
Chakshurindriyaarthavagrah, 
(3) 
Ghranendriya 
arthavagrah, 
(4) 
Jihvendriya arthavagrah, (5) Sparshanendriya arthavagrah and(6) No-indriya 
arthavagrah. 
COMMENTARY -The superficial perception of form etc. is arthavagrah. As a 
tiny spark can be turned into a source of light with right effort, in the same way 
simple knowledge can be turned into voluminous knowledge with the help of 
curiosity, thinking, contemplation, meditation, examination etc. The fleeting glance of 
information one gets is arthavagrah. This is accomplished though five sense organs 
and mind. 
Mind is called No-indriya. It has two divisions. One is dravya man or physical 
mind (brain) and the other is bhava man or the thinking-mind (mind). With the fruition 
of the manah-paryapti namakarma (the karma responsible for a fully developed 
mind) a being acquires the power to absorb the manovargana pudgals (particles of 
mental category or mentite particles) and create the physical organ that is called 
brain. As the body becomes healthy by nutrition so does the brain by absorbing fresh 
mentite particles, thereby it increases its capacity. As it is dependent on matter for its 
capacity it is called physical mind. 
The mental activity produced by this physical activity of the brain is called the 
bhava man or the mind. Mind cannot exist without brain but brain can exist without 
mind. Generally mind works in association with the sense organs. When it works 
independently without any help from the sense organs then No-lndriya arthavagrah 
takes place. 
FIVE NAMES OF ARTHAVAGRAH 
[115] MEANING -That arthavagrah has five names having one meaning, 
many inflections and many consonants - (1) Avagrahanata, (2) Updharanata, (3) 
Shravanata, (4) Avalambanata, and (5) Medha. 
This concludes the description of avagrah. 
COMMENTARY -The receiving of the particles of sound, form etc. in the first 
samaya is avagrah. It is said to'have -five names having one meaning, different 
pronunciations, and many consonants. These are also called paryayantar names 
(names of slight variations in attributes but still falling in the dame broad category). 
(1) Avagrahanata - The vyanjanavagrah that receives the particles of sound 
etc. lasts for antarmuhurt (less than forty eight minutes). The inexpressible 
indications received during the first samaya of this period is called avagrahanata 
(2) Updharanata - During the remaining period of vyanjanavagrah, every 
passing samaya new particles are received and the already received are contained. 
This process is called upadharan.ata. In other words during this process of 
acquisition of knowledge, the avagrah that joins different samayas into a continuity; 
and transforms the inexpressible into expressible is called upadharanata. 
 
NandiSootra 
 
Aagam- 44 -NandiSootra 
~ 105 ~ 
Compiled by- Deepratnasagar 
 
(3) Shravanata - The avagrah that is accomplished through the sense organ 
of hearing is called shravanata. 
(4) Avalambanata - The receiving of the meaning is calledavalambanata. This 
means that the avagrah that leads to dharanathrough iha and avaya is 
avalambanata. 
(5) Medha - The avagrah that receives the general as well as theparticular or 
the simple as well as detailed is called medha. 
The first two are related to vyanjanavagrah. Third is related toword or sound. 
The fourth and fifth, as a rule lead to iha, avaya anddharana... The flow of knowledge 
in some cases remains only up toavagrah, and in others it is progressive. 
SIX TYPES OF IHA 
[116] MEANING -Question - What are the types of this iha? 
Answer - Iha is said to be of six types – (1) Shrotrendriya iha, (2) Chakshu-
rindriya iha, (3) Ghranendriya iha, (4) Jihvendriyaiha, (5) Sparshanendriya iha, and 
(6) No-indriya iha. 
It has five names having one meaning, many inflections and many 
consonants - (1) Aabhoganata, (2) Marganata, (3) Gaveshanata, (4) Chinta, and (5) 
Vimarsh. 
This concludes the description of iha. 
COMMENTARY -The said six types of iha, like those of 
Arthavagrah, are based on the sense organs. The five paryayantarnames are 
as follows- 
Aabhoganata - The analysis directed at the real Meaning of athing after the 
process of arthavagrah is complete, is calledaabhoganata. 
Marganata - The process of understanding a thing throughsupporting and 
contradicting attributes is called marganata orexploration. 
Gaveshanata - The process of understanding a thing byrejecting the 
contradicting attributes and accepting the supportiveattributes is called gaveshanata. 
Chinta - To contemplate repeatedly the true meaning basedon the inherent 
attributes of a thing through intense kshayopashamis called chinta. 
Vimarsh - To think about the inherent meaning arrived atthrough above 
mentioned processes, rejecting the contradictions andaccepting related supportive 
attributes, is called vimarsh. 
SIX TYPES OF AVAYA 
[117] MEANING -Question - What are the types of this avaya? 
Answer - Avaya is, said to be of six types-(1) Shrotrendriya avaya, (2) 
Chakshu- rindriya avaya, (3) Ghranendriya avaya, (4) Jihvendriya avaya, (5) 
Sparshanendriya avaya, and (6) No-indriya avaya. 
It has five names having one meaning, many inflections and many 
consonants - 1) Aavartanata, 2) Pratyavartanata, 3) Avaya, 4) Buddhi, 5) Vijnana. 
This concludes the description of avaya. 
COMMENTARY -The said six types of avaya, like those of arthavagrah, are 
based on the sense organs. The five paryayantar names are as follows- 
Aavartanata - To acquire specialized knowledge of things after completion of 
iha with the intellectual effort in the direction of certainty is called avartanata. 
Pratyavartanata - To acquire specialized knowledge of the meanings after 
gaining the knowledge of things through aavartanata, with the help of iha only is 
called pratyavartanata. 
 
NandiSootra 
 
Aagam- 44 -NandiSootra

Compiled by- Deepratnasagar 
 
Avaya - The perfect knowledge of things from all angles is called avaya. 
Buddhi - When the perfection is with greater clarity it is called buddhi. 
Vijnana - To acquire specialized perfection of knowledge is called vijnana. 
These five names of avaya or ascertained knowledge are in fact five levels 
where the clarity and perfection of knowledge gradually increases. With the help of 
buddhi and vijnana the perfect and irrefutable knowledge of things is made possible. 
DHARANA 
[118] MEANING -Question - What is this dharana? 
Answer - Dharana is said to be of six types-(1) Shrotrendriya dharana, 
(2)Chakshurindria dharana (3) Ghranendriya dharana, (4) Jihvendriya dharana, (5) 
sparshanendriya dharana, (6) No-indriya dharana. 
It has five names having one meaning, many inflections, and.many 
consonants-1) Dharana, 2) Sadharana, 3) Sthapana, 4) Pratishtha, and 5) Koshth. 
This concludes the description of dharana. 
COMMENTARY -The said six types of dharama, like those of arthavagrah, 
are based on the sense organs. The five paryayantar names are as follows- 
Dharana - It is the memory that surfaces with proper coincidence after a 
minimum period of antarmuhurt (less than 48 minutes) and a maximum of 
uncountable period of time. 
Sadharana - It is to retain in memory, without forgetting, the absorbed 
meaning or information for antarmuhurt (less than 48 minutes). 
Sthapana - It is to put to memory the ascertained information. This is also 
known as vasana or samsakar. 
Pratishthai is to put into memory the information with divisions and sub-
diVisions known through avaya. 
Koshth - It is to keep the text and its meaning safe and secure into memory. 
Koshth means a bin or vault, and things like grain kept in them remains safe. 
The sequence of acquisition and gradual development of knowledge has been 
explained in the form of avagrah, avaya etc. Although the subject is the same, its 
clarity gradually increases. These levels of clarity have been given different names 
for a better understanding. 
THE DURATION 
[119] MEANING -(1) the duration of avagrah is only one samaya. (2) 
Theduration of iha is antarmuhurt (less than 48 minutes). (3) Theduration of avaya is 
antarmuhurt (less than 48 minutes).(4) The duration of dharana is both countable 
and uncountableperiod of time. 
COMMENTARY -The first' level of knowledge (acquiring of -) isavagrah. It 
lasts only for one samaya and then turns into iha. Theduration of iha is antarmuhurt 
(less than 48 minutes) after which itdevelops into avaya which also lasts for 
antarmuhurt (less than 48minutes). Now if attention or indulgence in it continues it is 
calledavichyuti dharana (irreversible reception) and not avaya. Dependingon the age 
of the being dharana can last for countable or uncountableperiod of time. In other 
words if the life span of a sentient being iscountable years the duration of dharana is 
also countable years. Thisavichyuti dharana strengthens vacana. 
VYANJANAVAGRAH EXAMPLE OF THE CALLER 
 
NandiSootra 
 
Aagam- 44 -NandiSootra 
~ 107 ~ 
Compiled by- Deepratnasagar 
 
[120] MEANING -1 will establish the said twenty eight divisions of 
abhinibodhik mati-jnana (four vyanjanavagrah, six arthavagrah, six iha, six avaya 
and six dharana) with the example of pratibodhak (the caller) and mallak (the bowl). 
Question - What is this example of the caller about Vyanjanavagrah? 
Answer - The example of the caller is like this - 
When a caller calls a sleeping person with some name like this - ""Hey 
someone! Hey someone!"" 
The disciple asks the guru - ""Then does his ear receive the particles entering 
the ears for one samaya, two samaya and so on up to ten samaya, or those entering 
for countable and uncountable samayas?"" 
The guru explains - ""The particles entering the ears in one samaya are not 
received, neither is those entering in two to ten samaya or even countable number of 
samayas. Only those entering the ears in uncountable number of samayas are 
received. 
This concludes the description of vyanjanavagrah with thehelp of the example 
of the caller. 
COMMENTARY -In the Jain system of measurement of time the word 
'samaYa' is not used in its traditional meaning (samaya = time). Here it means the 
smallest indivisible unit of time. Broadly speaking it is explained as - the time taken in 
a wink is equivalent touncountable number of samayas. Accordingly the particles 
entering ears for one to countable number of samayas convey only the inexpressible 
parts of any information. An expressible knowledge is carried into the ears by those 
particles that continue to enter the ears for uncountable number of samayas. 
The minimum duration of vyanjanavagrah is only inexpressible fraction of one 
avalika and maximum being prithaktva breath (inhalation + exhalation) (this is 
approximately equal to the duration of a single pulse of healthy human being). 
EXAMPLE OF THE BOWL 
Question - What is this example of mallak (the bowl)? 
Answer - The example of the caller is like this - If a man lifts a fresh earthen 
bowl from a potter's kiln andpours a drop of water in it, the drop disappears (soaked 
into thebowl). He then adds another drop and that too disappears. Thisway when he 
keeps on adding drops there will be one drop thatwill make the bowl wet, one drop 
that will stay a drop, one dropthat will fill the pot, and one drop that will spill out. 
In the same way by adding continuously when that vyanjan(consonant or 
sound) is filled with (formed by) infinite particles, then the person utters 'ya', but he is 
not certain about thesource of that sound. After this he enters the state of iha 
andthen only he knows about the source of sound. Then he entersthe state of avaya 
and converts that information intoknowledge. After this he enters the state of 
dharana andabsorbs the knowledge in his memory for countable oruncountable 
period of time. 
COMMENTARY -This is another appropriate example of vyanjanavagrah. As 
long as a fresh earthen pot is not completely wet or saturated, it keeps on soaking 
water. In such bowl when water is poured drop by drop, every drop is absorbed and 
lost. This continues till the last drop that makes the bowl saturated with water is 
dropped. The next drop remains as a drop in that pot. When this drop by drop 
pouring continues, slowly the pot gets filled and there is one last drop that fills the pot 
to the brim. The next drop spills out. 
 
NandiSootra

In the same way the particles o sound produced by calling a name keep on 
entering the ears every Samaya and striking the organ of hearing. When this activity 
continues for uncountable samayas the ears are saturated with these particles and 
then the reception of the consonant is complete and he utters - `ya'. Before this 
moment, as long as the particles continue to enter his ears he has inexpressible 
knowledge. This activity is called vyanjanavagrah. 
At the moment of saying yes he is not aware of the sound or its source. The 
particles of sound when further continue to enter his ears his state of sleep is broken, 
a question arises in his mind that what was that sound? This is the point of entry into 
the iha state where one after another many questions arise. For example - who 
produced this sound? What does it indicate? etc. When in this state of contemplation 
he knows the answers with certainty he is in the state of avaya. After making certain 
that the answers are correct he absorbs that sound into memory. This activity is 
called dharana. 
These two examples are about the sense organ of hearing only. The same is 
true for the other sense organs. The importance given to the organ of hearing is due 
to the fact that the organ of hearing is more closely associated with the path of 
spiritual uplift and development of knowledge which is inspired by the Shrut-jnana 
(the knowledge acquired through hearing or the verbal knowledge or the scriptural 
knowledge). 
SIX EXAMPLES OF AVAGRAH AND OTHERS 
1. A person with some name hears an indistinct sound. He receives it as 
'some sound' but is not aware of the exact sound or its source. He then enters the 
state of iha and then only he knows what sound it is. After this, he enters avaya and 
understands the information. Now he enters dharana and absorbs the information 
into his memory for countable or uncountable period of time. 
2. A person with some name sees an indistinct form. He receives it as 'some 
form' but is not aware of the exact form or its source. He then enters the state of iha 
and then only he knows what form it is. After this he enters avaya and understands 
the information. Now he enters dharana and absorbs the information into his memory 
for countable or uncountable period of time. 
3. A person with some name smells an indistinct odour. He receives it as 
'some odour' but is not aware of the exact odour or its source. He then enters the 
state of iha and then only he knows what odour it is. After this he enters avaya and 
understands the information. Now he enters dharana and absorbs the information 
into his memory for countable or, uncountable period of time. 
4. A person with some name gets an indistinct taste. He receives it as 'some 
taste' but is not aware of the exact taste or its source. He then enters the state of iha 
and then only he knows what taste it is. After this he enters avaya and understands 
the information. Now he enters dharana and absorbs the information into his memory 
for countable or uncountable period of time. 
5. A person with some name gets an indistinct touch. He receives it as 'some 
touch' but is not aware of the exact touch or its source. He then enters the state of 
iha and then only he knows what touch it is. After this he enters avaya and 
understands the information. Now he enters dharana and absorbs the information 
into his memory for countable or uncountable period of time. 
6. A person with some name sees an indistinct dream. He receives it as 'some 
dream' but is not aware of the exact dream or its source. He then enters the state of 
 
NandiSootra 
 
Aagam- 44 -NandiSootra

iha and then only he knows what dream it is. After this he enters avaya and 
understands the information. Now he enters dharana and absorbs the information 
into his memory for countable or uncountable period of time. 
COMMENTARY -According to the above mentioned details vyanjanavagrah is 
a process involving all sense organs except eyes and mind. These two have 
arthavagrah. No-indriya means mind, and its activity is thinking or contemplating. To 
clarify avagrah in its context the example used is dream. While dreaming, the 
physical sense organs are generally inactive. All the experiences are done by mind 
which when awake takes the dream experiences to avagrah, iha, avaya and 
dharana. It is not necessary that it take all the things seen in a dream up to the level 
of dharana. Some things remain only up to avagrah, others up to iha and'still others 
upto avaya. 
Acharya Malayagiri, the commentator (in vritti), while clarifying vyanjan-
avagrah with the help of the example of mallak, has also given detailed description of 
mati-jnana. There are 28 categories of mati-jnana (four vyanjanavagrah, six 
arthavagrah, six iha, six avaya, and six dharana). Of these, each has 12 sub-
categories with reference to capacity, taking the total to 336. 
The mati-jnana acquired through, six means - five sense organs and mind - 
has twenty four categories based, on avagrah, iha, avaya, and dharana. Each of 
these has 12 divisions in terms of capacity depending upon variations in subjects 
and levels of kshayopasham. These twelve divisions are as follows - 
Bahugrahi - This is the capacity to absorb more in terms of numbers and 
volume. To know many modes and forms of a thing, to know about a thing or subject 
of larger volume, etc. is included in this. 
Alpagrahi - This is the capacity to know only one mode of a thing or subject 
and that too to a minute degree. 
Bahuvidhagrahi - This is the capacity to know a thing, substance, or subject 
in many ways. For example, to understand the type, form, shape, colour, length, 
breadth, etc. from varied perspectives. 
Alpavidhagrahi - This is the capacity to know a thing, substance, or subject 
in fewer ways. 
Kshipragrahi - This is the capacity to know the thoughts of a speaker or a 
writer through any sense organ or mind; also to recognize a thing or a person by a 
mere touch, in the dark. 
Akshipragrahi - This is the capacity to know any subject of any sense organ 
or mind with slow speed in an unpracticed state caused by lower degree of 
kshayopasham or diverted attention. 
Anishritgrahi - This is the capacity to know the properties and variations of a 
thing merely through focussed attention or inspiration even in absence of any cause 
or a medium. 
Nishritgrahi - This is the capacity to know the properties and variations of a 
thing only with the help of some cause, medium, reason, etc. 
Asandigdhagrahi - This is the capacity to know the properties and variations 
of a thing without any ambiguity. 
Sandigdhagrahi - This is the capacity to know the properties and variations 
of a thing with ambiguity. 
Dhruvagrahi - This is the capacity to know a thing or a subject on getting 
proper medium in a proper way with certainty and to retain the information always. 
 
NandiSootra 
 
Aagam- 44 -NandiSootra 
~ 110 ~ 
Compiled by- Deepratnasagar 
 
Adhruvagrahi - This is the absence of capacity to know a thing even after 
getting proper medium or to retain the information always, if known. 
The inspiring causes of Bahu, Bahuvidha, Kshipra, Anishrit, Asandigdha, and 
Dhruva, these six capacities are focussing of attention, practice, and higher degree 
of kshayopasham. The inspiring causes of Alpa, Alpavidha, Akshipra, Nishrit, 
Sandigdha, and Adhruva, these six capacities are wavering attention, absence of 
practice, and lower degree of kshayopasham. 
These are the 336 broad divisions of mati-jnana. The minute divisions are 
infinite. 
The above said four main divisions of mati-jnana are sequential. Knowledge 
becomes complete in this order - avagrah, iha, avaya, and dharana. Even when 
incomplete it follows the same sequence. Some times the progress is terminated at 
avagrah, some times at iha, and some times at avaya. The subject in the state of 
avagrah develops only with an effort. The development of knowledge is in proportion 
to the capacity of dharana. 
✻THE SUBJECTS OF MATI-JNANA✻ 
[121] MEANING -In brief this abhinibodhik mati-jnana is said to be of 
fourtypes-1. About substance, 2. About area, 3. About time and 4.about modes. 
With the help of mati-jnana about substance a mati jnanigenerally knows all 
substances but does not see them. 
With the help of mati-jnana about area a mati jnanigenerally knows all areas 
but does not see them. 
With the help of mati- 'vana about time a matt jnanigenerally knows all the 
three divisions of time - past, present, and futures - but does not see them. 
With the help of matt-jnana about modes a mati jnanigenerally knows all 
Modes but does not see them. 
COMMENTARY -In these sentences the word `adesh has been used, which 
means types or categories. To know some thing in some ways means to know it 
superficially in various ways. To know it in depth means to know all its aspects every 
way. Here it has been used in the sense of 'generally'. 
CONCLUSION 
[122] MEANING -In brief there are four sequential divisions of abhinibodhik 
mati-jnana - avagrah, iha, avaya, and dharana. 
[123] MEANING -The first encounter with or the reception of meaning 
(information) is called avagrah. The analysis of the received information is iha. The 
ascertaining decision is avaya. The stability of indulgence (avichyuti) in that is 
memory (smriti), and involvement in or attachment (vasana) with it is dharana. 
[124] MEANING -The duration of avagrah is one samaya, that of iha and 
avaya is antarmuhurt (less than 48 minutes), and that of dharana is both countable 
and uncountable period of time. 
[125] MEANING -Sound is heard through a fleeting contact with organ of 
hearing but form is seen without contact. Smell, taste are experienced by intimate 
contact. 
[126] MEANING -The bunch of particles of sound uttered by a speaker are 
heard by a listener at the same level in the transferred form. A listener at a different 
level, as a rule, hears only when there is a shift in the level of transference. 
COMMENTARY -When a person utters some sound he transforms particles 
 
NandiSootra 
 
Aagam- 44 -NandiSootra 
~ 111 ~ 
Compiled by- Deepratnasagar 
 
of sound in words and then speech and transmits them. These particles proceed in 
different directions at different levels in space. But this act of progression is 
facilitated by collision with other particles of sound present in space. A listener 
located at the same level at which these particles are moving only hears this collided 
or transferred sound (mixed form of sound). Generally these sound particles proceed 
only at a specific level. But the collision with other particles makes some particles 
shift into another level. This is called paraghat or shift of level. A listener at different 
level hears only when this shift occurs, otherwise not. 
[127] MEANING -Iha, apoh, vimarsh, margana, gaveshana, sanjna, smriti, 
mati, prajna, and buddhi are all synonyms of abhinibodhikjnana. 
[128] MEANING -This concludes the description of abhinibodhikjnana parox. 
COMMENTARY -The synonyms of mati-jnana are - 
Iha - the conceiving of the proper meaning. 
Apoh - to ascertain. 
Vimarsh - the intervening thought process between iha and, awaya. 
Margana - the search for supporting values. 
Gaveshana - the comparison with opposing values-. 
Sanjna - to find similarities between the experiences of the past and the thing 
being experienced now. 
Smriti - to recall the thing experienced in the past. 
Prajna - to analyze and understand the inherent properties of a thing with the 
help of the capacity born out of special kshayopasham. 
Mati - the knowledge that perceives the subject presently under consideration 
or observation. 
Buddhi - The ultimate development of avaya. 
Special - With the help of jatismaran jnana, which is a form of mati jnana, one 
can know a maximum number of 900 earlier births as a sentient being. When the 
mati jnana reaches its full capacity it becomes apratipati or indestructible. Once this 
state is reached Kewal-jnana is inevitable. But a person having minimum or middle 
level of mati-jnana may or may not attain Kewal-jnana. 
✻SHRUT-JNANA✻ 
[129] MEANING -Question - What are the types of this shrut-jnanaparoksh? 
Answer - Shrut-jnana paroksh is said to be of fourteenstypes-1. Akshar shrut, 
2.Anakshar shrut, 3.Sanjni shrut, 4.Asanjni shrut, 5.Samyak shrut, 6.Mithya shrut, 
7.Sadik shrut, 8.anadik shrut, 9. Saparyavasit shrut, 10.Aparyavasit shrut11.Gamik 
shrut, 12.Agamik shrut, 13.Angapravisht and14.Anangapravisht shrut. 
COMMENTARY -Like mati-jnana, shrut mana is also indirectknowledge. 
Shrut-jnana is acquired after having mati-jnana. In other words shrut-jnana can be 
acquired only with the help of mati-jnana.Therefore it has been mentioned after mati-
jnana. 
Out of tneso 14 types the first two are the main categories. These two 
combine within them all the other categories. However, tomake it easy to understand 
for common man these have beenexpanded into 14.

Question - What is this Sanjna akshar? 
Answer - The shape or structure of akshar (letter) is sanjnaakshar. 
Question - What is this Vyanjana akshar? 
Answer - That which is pronounced vocally is vyanjanaakshar. 
Question - What is this Labdhi akshar? 
Answer - A being with the akshar labdhi (vocal power) iscapable of acquiring 
the knowledge called labdhi akshar. For example Shrotrendriya labdhi akshar, 
Chaksu-rindriya 
labdhiakshar, 
Ghranendriya 
labdhi 
akshar, 
Jihvendriya 
labdhiakshar, Sparshanendriya labdhi akshar, and No-indriya labdhiakshar. 
COMMENTARY -That which does not decay or deplete is called akshar. 
Jnana is the eternal and inherent activity of a being. When the existence of jnana 
comes to an end, the being ceases to exist. As it is the non-decaying attribute of a 
soul, jnana is also known as akshar. In other words it is a synonym of jnana. The 
form it takes for expressing thoughts is also known as akshar (a letter or an 
alphabet). The three categories of akshar shrut have been made on this basis only. 
Sanjna akshar - That which is given the name (sanjna) of akshar is called 
sanjna akshar. In other words the particular shape or form with which a particular 
letter or sound is recognized is called sanjna akshar. This includes various 
characters, or alphabets, or symbols with which various sounds are recognized. For 
example a, b, c, d, e, f, etc. 
Vyanjana akshar - The meaningful acoustic expression of akshar is vyanjana 
akshar. When we pronounce an akshar or a group of akshars, words and sentences 
are formed. The organized form of these words and sentences express our thoughts. 
This expression can be compiled in various forms like article, play, poetry, book etc. 
In brief, scripts are sanjna akshar and books are vyanjana akshar. 
Labdhi akshar - The thought form of akshar is labdhi akshar. After hearing a 
sound or seeing a form, to experience and understand its meaning is known as 
thought form or jnana form of akshar. In other words, after hearing a word or a 
sound, the knowledge produced with the help of sense organs and mind through the 
process of analysis is called labdhz akshar. 
Broadly looking it appears that labdhi akshar is confined to sentient beings 
only. But in fact, it is not that thoughts and feelings are absent where sense organs 
are absent. Under developed or non-sentient beings also undergo kshayopasham. 
Therefore they also acquire bhava shrut although it is inexpressible. Such beings 
also have feelings like hunger, fear, sex, fondness, attachment, etc. A feeling or 
desire, even if it is inexpressible is related to words. Therefore it is believed that such 
beings also have labdhi akshar. This is of six types- 
Shrotrendriya labdhi akshar - to grasp the meaning or purpose through word, 
language, sound and variations in its intensity. 
Chaksurindriya labdhi akshar - to grasp the meaning or purpose by reading a 
text and seeing signs, expressions and gestures. 
Ghranendriya labdhi akshar - to grasp the meaning or purpose by smell and 
its variations. 
Jihvendriya labdhi akshar - to grasp the meaning or purpose by taste and its 
variations. 
Sparshanendriya labdhi akshar - to grasp the meaning or purpose smell and 
its variations.

No-indriya labdhi akshar - to grasp the meaning or purpose by feeling, 
thoughts or contemplation 
Mati-jnana and shrut-jnana both are produced with the help of five sense 
organs and mind."" These are acquired gradually. Mati-jnana is cause and shrut-
jnana its effect or activity. Mati-jnana isnatural or spontaneous and general, whereas 
shrut-jnana -is acquiredwith effort and is specific. Mati-jnana is inexpressible and 
shrut-jnana is expressible. 
ANAKSHAR SHRUT 
[131] MEANING -Question - What is this anakshar shrut? 
Answer - Anakshar shrut is of many types - exhalation, inhalation, spitting, 
coughing, sneezing, blowing nose, nasalsound, etc. 
[132] MEANING -This concludes the description of anakshar shrut. 
COMMENTARY -The sounds produced just to indicate some thing or as a 
gesture and not used to express any letter or word are calledAnakshar shrut. The 
sounds that have no meaning or are produced without any specific purpose are not 
included in this. The sounds created for some purpose, to warn others, to indicate 
benefit or harm, or for any other use are included in anakshar shrut. 
SANJNI AND ASANJNI SHRUT 
[133] MEANING -Question - What is this sanjni shrut? 
Answer - Sanjni shrut is said to be of three types- 
(1) Withreference to kaliki upadesh, (2) with reference to hetu upadesh, and 
(3) with reference to drishtivad upadesh 
Question - What is this with reference to kaliki upadesh? 
Answer - Those who have iha, apoh, margana, gaveshana, chinta and 
vimarsh are called sanjni (sentient) beings. Thosewho do not have iha, apoh, 
margana, gaveshana, chinta andvimarsh are called asanjni (non-sentient) beings. 
The knowledge of these is called sanjni shrut or asanjni shrut withreference to kaliki 
upadesh. 
Question - What is this with reference to hetu upadesh? 
Answer - That which has the capacity to act according to analysis through 
wisdom is called sanjni being. That which does not have the capacity to act 
according to analysis through wisdom is called asanjni (non-sentient) being. The 
knowledge ofthese is called sanjni shrut or asanjni shrut with reference tohetu 
upadesh. 
Question - What is this with reference to drishtivadupadesh? 
Answer - That who has had kshayopasham of sanjni shrut iscalled sanjni 
(sentient) being. That who has had Kshayopasham of asanjni shrut is called asanjni 
(non-sentient) (sentient) being. The knowledge of these is called sanjni shrut or 
asanjni shrut respectively with reference to drishtivad upadesh. 
This concludes the description of sanjni and asanjni shrut. 
COMMENTARY -There are three alternatives of sanjni (sentient) and asanjnt 
(non-sentient) beings. The shrut related to these three alternatives is called sanjni 
shrut and asanjni shrut. The three alternatives are as follows- 
Kaliki upadesh (Deergh-kaltki upadesh) - Kaltkt means time related. From 
long term view point a sanjni (sentient) being is that which after coming in contact 
with the information or knowledge gradually absorbs it through the sequence of tha, 
apoh, margana, gaveshana, chinta and vimarsh. In brief a being that has the 
capacity to absorb a thing or a subject in this way is called a sanjni (sentient) being.

The placental beings with fully developed mind, the aupapatic beings (gods), and the 
hell beings come in this class. Their knowledge is called sanjni shrut. 
The beings that do not have this capacity are called asanjni (non-sentient) 
beings. Sammoorchim five sensed beings, and four, three, and two sensed beings 
come in this class. The beings with manah-paryapti (fully developed mind) have 
enough mano labdhi (mental capacity) to absorb information and knowledge with 
clarity. With the decline in level this clarity gradually reduces. At the lowest level are 
the one sensed beings that have the minimum clarity. Their knowledge is called 
asanjni shrut. 
Hetu upadesh - With this view point a sanjni (sentient) being is that who 
understands the cause and accordingly decides to indulge or not in any activity. It 
goes towards benefits and away from harm. These beings include house fly, 
mosquitoes, etc. the movements of whom are dependent on factors like day and 
night, sun or shade, availability and non-availability of food, and pleasure and pain. 
Fromthis angle they all fall under the category of sanjni (sentient) beings. Their 
knowledge is sanjni shrut. 
All those beings whose indulgence and non indulgence is not dependent on 
benefits and harms are asanjni (non-sentient) beings. Their knowledge is called 
asanjni shrut. 
Drishtivad upadesh - Drishti means perception. A being which has right 
perception is called a sanjni (sentient) being. In other words - who has the 
knowledge of kshayopasham; or who properly knows about what is good or bad for 
the soul, is a sanjni (sentient) being. Only such sanjni (sentient) being tries to refrain 
from feelings of attachment and aversion that are harmful for the soul and proceeds 
to acquire the benefit in the form of liberation. 
That which does not properly know and understand good and bad, in context 
of soul is asanjni (non-sentient) being. Such asanjni (non-sentient) being is 
mithyadrishti (having false perception or belief). He considers beneficial what is 
actually harmful for the soul and instead of refraining, continues to indulge in that. 
Thereby he continues to move away from the path of liberation. 
When we look at all these alternatives together we find that in drishtivad 
upadesh, only those beings are included who have acquired samyaktva. In kaliki 
upadesh those beings are included who have the potential to head towards 
samyaktva. Those who are just mithyadrishti are included in hetu upadesh. This 
means that besides the immobile beings all other beings are sanjnt (sentient). Thus 
shrut or knowledge exists in all prani (two, three, four sensed beings), bhoot 
(organisms), jiva (five sensed beings), and sattva (entities) irrespective of their being 
asanjni (non-sentient). 
(a) SAMYAK SHRUT 
[134] MEANING -Question - What is this samyak shrut? 
Answer - The box of knowledge comprising of the twelve Angas; propagated 
by Arhat Bhagavans, the possessors of the directly acquired knowledge and 
perception, profoundly revered and devoutly saluted by the beings of three worlds, 
the all seeing and all knowing omniscients who know past, present, and future; is 
called samyak shrut. The Angas are - Acharang, Sutrakritang, Sthanang, 
Samvayang, Vyakhya Prajnapti, Jnatadharmakathang, Upasakdashang, Antkrut-
dashang, Anuttaraupapatik dashang, Prashna Vyakaran, Vipak Shrut, and 
Drishtivad. These twelve Angas are the samyak shrut of the knowers of the fourteen 
 
NandiSootra 
 
Aagam- 44 -NandiSootra

Compiled by- Deepratnasagar 
 
purvas. These also are the samyak shrut of all the knowers of the ten purvas. There 
is an ambiguity about those who know less than this. Their shrut may and may not 
be the samyak shrut. 
This concludes the description of samyak shrut. 
COMMENTARY -Samyak shrut means the pure and direct knowledge of the 
true reality. Seven adjectives have been used here; for the propagators of such 
knowledge -- 
Arhat - Those who have made, their soul absolutely pure by rooting out the 
influence of tough vitiating karmas as well as the spiritual vices like attachment, 
aversion, lust, and anger. And consequently wiped out the cause of rebirth. 
Bhagavant - Those great souls that are endowed with great altruistic virtues 
like ultimate grandeur, unlimited power, all enveloping fame, extreme radiance, 
transparently pure spirituality, and untiring endeavour directed at incessant flow of 
spontaneous compassion. 
Utpanna Jnana-darshan dharak - Those who have been enlightened and 
endowed with self realized direct perception and knowledge Knowledge and 
perception can be acquired indirectly with the help of studies, listening, practice, and 
other means. This is not self realized direct knowledge but indirect knowledge. 
Samadrit and namaskrit - Those who are revered because they spread the 
light of their untainted direct knowledge throughout the three worlds and are saluted 
with devotion for this spontaneous compassion. 
Trikalajna - Those who have the capacity to know past, present and future 
Directly and without any outside means or method. 
Sarvajna - Those who directly know every substance from every angle and 
whose knowledge is all pervading. 
Sarvadarshi - Those who directly perceive every substance from every angle 
and whose view and viewpoint are all pervading. 
Only those great men who are endowed with these seven attributes are the 
propagators of sarnyak shrut. Their sermons were secured within twelve ganipitaks 
(boxes of ganadhars, a metaphor for canons). When we think of samyak shrut being 
in the form of human body these twelve boxes form the twelve main parts of that 
body. That is why these are also called the twelve Angas (parts). 
The words of those great men, who absorb this samyak shrut, also become 
samyak shrut. In this category come the eleven Angas and fourteen purvas of the 
twelfth Anga. There is a belief that the words of those great men who absorb the 
eleven Angas and complete ten purvas of the twelfth Anga are also samyak shrut. 
The words ofthose who know a little less than ten purvas may or may not besamyak 
shrut. The reason for this is said to be that the knowers of tento fourteen purvas are 
necessarily samyakdrishti. Those who knowless than this are not necessarily 
samyakdrishti. This means thateven the mithyadrishti can study up to a little less 
than ten purvas. 
MITHYA SHRUT 
[135] MEANING -Question - What is this mithya shrut? 
Answer - The scriptures which are conceived by ignorantand mithyadrishti 
individuals through their intellect and vieware called mithya shrut. For example-             
1.Bharat, 2.Ramayan, 3.Bhimasurokta, 4.Kautilya, 5.Shakatabhadirka, 6.Ghotaka- 
mukh, 7.Karpasik, 8.Naag-sukshma, 9.Kanakasaptati 10.Vaisheshik, 11.Buddha 
vachan, 12.Trairashik, 13.Kapiliya, 14.Lokayat, 15.Shashtitantra, 16.Mathew, 
 
NandiSootra

17.Purana, 18.Vyakaran, 19.Bhagavat, 20.Patanjali, 21. Pushyadaivat, 22. Lekh, 
23.Ganit, 24.Shakunirut, and25.Natak.Also the seventy two arts andcrafts and the 
Vedas with their angopangas (derivative literature based on the Vedas). 
All these are the mithya shrut (scriptures) conceived througlthe false 
perception of mithyadrishti. These same become thesamyak shrut when conceived 
through the right perception of samyakdrishti. Also these same are the samyak shrut 
for themithyadrishti because these become the inspiring cause for samyaktva and 
influence him to abandon his dogmas of mithyadrishti. 
This concludes the description of mithya shrut. 
COMMENTARY -The scriptures propagated by mtthyadrishti individuals are 
called mithya shrut. Mithyadrishti is one whose thoughts are inspired by mithyatva 
(false perception or belief). Mithyatva is said to be of ten types as follows- 
Adhamme dhammasanna - To accept false religion as right religion.For 
example, to indulge in animal sacrifice in name of gods and goddesses and consider 
it to be a religious act. 
Dhamme adhammasanna - To consider right religion to be false religion.For 
example, to consider the path of purity of soul as nonreligious. 
Umagge maggasanna - To consider the wrong path (path of sorrows) to be 
the right path (the path of happiness). 
Magge umaggasanna - To consider the right path to be the wrong path. For 
example, to consider right perception, knowledge, and conduct, which leads to 
liberation, to be the path of sorrow. 
Ajivesu jivasanna - To consider non-living as living.For example, to believe 
that all activity in 'this world is the activity of beings and there is no existence of 
anything non-living. 
Jivesu ajtvasanna - To consider living as non-living. For example, to believe 
that the only living beings in this world are human beings and animals and there is 
no existence of any other living beings. 
Asahusu sahusanna - To consider non-ascetic as ascetic. To accept as an 
ascetic a person who has renounced nothing including wealth and grandeur, wife 
and son, etc. To accept as an ascetic a person who has no virtues of an ascetic and 
is just dressed as one. 
Sahusu asahusanna - To, consider ascetic as non-ascetic. To believe a true 
ascetic having all virtues, to be non-ascetic just because of opposing views or his 
dress. 
Amuttesu muttasanna - To consider non-liberated to be liberated. To accept 
as liberated those who have not come out of the trap of rebirth by cleansing the soul 
of the dirt of karmas. 
Muttesu amuttasanna - To consider liberated to be non-liberated. To accept 
as non-liberated, those who have attained moksha with the belief that man is never 
liberated, a simple soul (atma) cannot become the Ultimate-soul (Paramatma), the 
soul can never be free of the trap of karmas. 
In simple terms this means - to accept true as false and vice versa without 
properly judging the vices and virtues or the supporting and contradicting evidences, 
is called mithyatva. As knowledge depends on capacity, with the development of the 
capacity a perspn rejects falsity and progresses towards truth. But a mithyatvi 
because of his dogma chokes his own path of progress.

After giving the list of mithya shruts a very important fact has been mentioned. 
The scriptures are not false in themselves, it is because of the mithyadrishtt (wrong 
interpretation) that they are false. In other words, knowledge in itself is not false; it is 
the mithyadrtshti who spoils it with his falsity and steers it in the direction of harm. 
For this reason it becomes mithya shrut. The same knowledge becomes right 
knowledge for a samyakdrishti person because he steers it towards the ultimate 
benefit that is liberation. 
SAADI, SAANT, ANAADI AND ANANT SHRUT 
[136] MEANING -Question - What is this saadi saparyavasit and anadi 
aparyavasit shrut? 
Answer - This twelve Anga ganipitak is soadi saparyavasit (with a beginning 
and an end) from the pa aya naya (view point of variations). It is anaadi aparya tsit 
(without a beginning and an end) from the dravyarthik aya (view pointof substance). 
This shrut-jnana, in brief, said to be offour types - with reference to the parameters ‘f 
(1) substance, (2) area, (3) time, and (4) mode. In these four- 
1. With reference to substance, the samya' shrut related to one person is 
saadi saparyavasit and that •elated to many persons is anaadi aparyavasit. 
2. With reference to area, in five Bharat ', and five Airavat areas the samyak 
shrut is saadi saparyavasit and in the! Mahavideh area it is anaadi aparyavasit. 
3. With reference to time, in context of progressive and; regressive cycles of 
time the samyak shrut is saadi saparyavasit and without the context of time cycles it 
is anaadi aparyavasit. 
4. With reference to mode (thoughts, precepts), in context ofd the precepts of 
the omniscient the samyak shrut is saadi; saparyavasit because these 
precepts are stated, propagated, + elaborated, explained, clarified, and simplified for 
the benefit of the common man. However, in context of the principles of; 
kshayopasham it is anaadi aparyavasit. In other words thei shrut of bhav-siddhik 
being is saadi saparyavasit and that of! Abhav-siddhik being is anaadi aparyavasit. 
The infinite multiplication of the total periphery of the space! with total number 
of space points gives the value of paryaya akshar (the total number of existing 
modes). An infinitesimalifraction of the akshar (shrut-jnana) is ever open or unveiled. 
If this also gets veiled the being will turn into non-being or life will turn into matter. No 
matter how dense is the cover of clouds the radiance of the sun and the moon does 
not completely vanish? 
This concludes the description of saadi saparyavasit and anaadi aparyavasit. 
COMMENTARY -Ganipitak or the scriptures propagated by the Arhat or the 
words arc saadt saparyavasit from the vyavacchttt naya or paryayarthik naya (view 
point of variations). Which means that with reference to variations it has both 
beginning as well as end but from avyavacchitt naya or dravyarthth naya (view point 
of substance) it is anaadt aparyavasit?Which means that in its fundamental 
existence as jnana it is without any beginning or an end? 
From this point of view it has four categories- 
(1) With reference to substance - The samyak shrut related to one person is 
saadi saparyavasit. When a being acquires samyaktva, it is the beginning of samyak 
shrut for him. When he reaches the first or the third gunasthan, once again mithyatva 
surfaces. That shrut is lost due to lethargy, perversions, acute pain or loss of 
memory. In other direction, when the individual keeps on progressing in the 
rightdirection, Ketval-sinana is acquired. Here also the shrut is lost. This is the end of 
 
NandiSootra 
 
Aagam- 44 -NandiSootra 
~ 118 ~ 
Compiled by- Deepratnasagar 
 
samyak shrut for him.The samyak shrut related to many persons is anaadt 
aparyauastt. At some place or the other there always is a person who has samyak 
shrut. There neither was, or is, nor will be a situation when there was, is, or will be 
not a single being having samyak shrut. 
With reference to area - In five Bharat and five Airavat, these ten areas the 
samyak shrut is with a beginning and an end (saadi saparyavasit). Around the end of 
the sukkham-dukkham era of the regressive cycle of time and around the beginning 
of the duhkham-sukkham era of the progressive cycle of time the Tirthankar, to 
establish the religious organization, first of all propagates the samyak shrut. This is 
the beginning of the samyak shrut. In the duhkham-duhkham era the shrut becomes 
extinct. This is the end of the samyak shrut. In the five Mahavideh areas it is without 
a beginning or an end (anaadt aparyavasit) because it always, exists. 
With reference to time - Where the progressive and, regressive cycles of 
time are effective the samyak shrut is with al beginning and an end. In five Bharat 
and five Airavat these cycles of time are effective. Where these cycles of time are 
not effective, due to uniform conditions in context of time cycles the samyak shrut 
always exists; or it is without a beginning or an end. In the Mahavideh area the time 
cycles are not effective. 
With reference to mode (thoughts, precepts) - In context of the precepts of 
the omniscient, propagated in simple terms with numerous categories and examples, 
the samyak shrut is with a beginning and an end. This is because it starts with the 
acquisition of samyaktva and ends with mithyatva as well as omniscience. However, 
in context of the principles of kshayopasham it is without a beginning or an end. This 
is because, to the beings, in which the process of kshayopasham has begun, the 
samyak shrut is always available. And to the beings in which the process of 
kshayopasham has not begun, the mithya shrut is always available. 
In other words the shrut of bhav-siddhik (destined to be liberated) being is 
with a beginning and an end and that of abhav-stddhik (not destined to be liberated) 
being is without a beginning or an end. 
This can be summed up in four categories- 
Saadt-saant (with a beginning and an end) - When samyaktva is attained the 
Angas are studied. Either on regressing to mithytva or on attaining omniscience the 
acquired shrut (knowledge) vanishes. This is in context of the beings destined to 
liberation. 
Saadi-anant (with a beginning and without an end) - This is invalid here 
because samyak shrut and mithya shrut both have beginning as well as end. With 
the rise of samyaktva mithya shrut vanishes, with the rise of mtthyatva samyak shrut 
vanishes, and with attaining of omniscience both vanish. 
Anadi-saant (without a beginning and with an end) - The mithya shrut of the 
beings destined to liberation is in existence since infinite time and it vanishes with 
the rise of samyaktva. This is with reference to the bhavya beings. 
Anadi-anant (without a beginning or an end) - The mrthya shrut of the beings 
not destined to liberation is in existence since infinite time. Such beings never 
acquire samyaktva. Therefore it will remain in existence always. 
PARYAYAKSHAR 
The square of the total number of space points in the inhabited and 
uninhabited space when added to the infinite gross and subtle modes (variable) 
existing within each and every space point gives the number that is called 
 
NandiSootra 
 
Aagam- 44 -NandiSootra 
~ 119 ~ 
Compiled by- Deepratnasagar 
 
Paryayakshar. It means all the modes (alternatives and variables) existing in the 
universe. Kewaljnani knows all these. 
To understand the ultimate state of knowledge it becomes necessary to take 
help of numbers. Suppose Kewaljnana is math up of a very large number of 
indivisible units or prime numbers when this number is divided by one less than 
ekattht, the resulting number of such indivisible units is called ahshar. An infinitesima 
fraction of akshar is equal to the smallest unit of paryaya jnana. 
All beings always have the capacity to know this tiny unit of paryaya-inana this 
can also be termed as the smallest part of shrut-jnana. If that also is obscured by 
infinite karma particles, a being turns into a non-being or matter. But this does not 
happen. The densest clouds cannot completely obscure the radiance of the sun or 
the moon, in the same way in spite of its every section being veiled by infinite karma 
particles, soul is never completely devoid of chetna (the unique pulsating spiritual 
attribute of soul that sets it apart from matter). A being in the state of minute nigod 
(dormant being) also has some shrut, no matter how small. 
GAMIK, AGAMIK, ANGAPRAVISHT AND ANGABAHYA 
[137] MEANING-Question - What is this gamik shrut? 
Answer - Drishtivad is gamik shrut. 
Question - What is this agamik shrut? 
Answer - Kalik shrut is agamik shrut. 
This concludes the description of gamik and agamik shrut. Also, they are, in 
brief, said to be of two types- 
(1) Angapravisht and (2) Angabahya. 
Question - What is this Angabahya shrut? 
Answer Angabahya shrut is said to be of two types- 
(1) Avashyak and (2) other than Avashyak. 
Question - What is this Avashyak shrut? 
Answer - Avashyak shrut is said to be of six types - (1) Samayik, (2) Chatur- 
vinshati stav, (3) Vandana, (4) Pratikraman, (5) Kayotsarg, and(6) Pratyakhyan. 
This concludes the description of Avashyak shrut. 
COMMENTARY -Gamik shrut - In this category of scriptures there are some 
specific words or sentences that are often repeated with slight variations at its 
beginning, in the middle, and in the end. For example, in the tenth chapter of 
Uttaradhyayan Sutra, - ""Samayam Goyam! Ma Pamayae."" - is used in the fourth line 
of every stanza. Drishtivad is in this style. 
Agamik shrut - In this category of scriptures there is no similarity in parts of 
the text and no repetitions as well. Acharang and other kalik sutras are in this style. 
Angapravisht - A complete man has twelve parts in his body - two legs, two 
thighs, two breasts, two flanks, two arms, one neck and one head. In the same way 
the scripture-god has 12 parts. As the main parts of the body are called angas, so 
are called the main parts of the scripture-god. The Angas comprise of the canons 
written by the Ganadhars on the basis of the word of the Tirthankars. 
Angabahya - The scriptures written with the help of the Angas, by scholars 
other than Ganadhars are called Angabahya.

expresses about the absence of any desire for the boons, the god offers homage to 
that contented and detached ascetic, and leaves. This is the theme of this work. 
23. Utthanashrut - This deals with ucchatan (to spread disturbances by 
casting a spell through mantra chanting).

acquiring knowledge that was followed by the great sages of the past is achar. The 
book in which this subject has been discussed is also called achar. In the Shraman 
tradition it means - the conduct based scripture in which mainly the subject of codes 
of conduct of shraman nirgranth (Jain ascetic) has been discussed in complete detail 
is known as Acharang Sutra. 
0-The five subjects included in this are as follows- 
I. Jnanachar- (knowledge-conduct) - The conduct necessary for acquisition of

(perfect righteousness) or vishuddha samyaktva (pure righteousness). With this 
inclination comes gradually strengthening faith in fundamentals of religion. This is 
called vyavahar samyaktva (applied righteousness). The activities of purifying, 
strengthening, and enhancing samyaktva are called darshanachar. It has eight parts- 
Nihshankit - To have no doubts in the words of the Arhat, religion propagated 
by the Kewali, Dharma sangh (religious organization), and the means to attain 
liberation. To have faith in the fundamental that is soul, without any reservations.

Uvabrimhan - To actively encourage those who indulge in service of the 
religious organization, literary activities, practices of discipline and austerities, and

the beings who have been caught into the trap of attachment or have drifted away 
from the right path is Sutrakrit; that which systematically compiles numerous 
subjects, sects and their branches, and beliefs, as pearls in a string, is Sutrakrtt. 
The forms of lok (inhabited space), alok (un-inhabited space or the space 
beyond), and lokalok (inhabited and un-inhabited space) have been defined in 
Sutrakritang Sutra. No dravya (substance) changes its fundamental form; neither 
does it take the form of any other dravya (substance). 
This dravyatva (the fundamental attribute of being substance) of dravya has 
been defined. It has been shown that pure being is Shuddhatma (pure soul) or 
Pararnatma (Ultimate- or Super-soul); pure non-being is matter; and the worldly 
being is that which has a body which comes into existence due to the combination of 
soul and matter. 
Sutrakritang Sutra discusses principles of sva-darshan (own philosophy or 
Jain philosophy), par-darshan (other philosophy) and sva-par-darshan or ubhaya-
darshan (comparative philosophical view). The brief introduction of other 
philosophical schools is as follows- 
Kriyavadi - They consider the concept of nine fundamentals as baseless and 
false. As they are ignorant of and apathetic to the true form of religion, they favour 
the indulgence in superficial/ ostentations and rituals. As they believe in the 
supremacy of a creator God they are also known as astik (theists). They are said to 
be of 120 different types. 
Akriyavadi - They oppose the nine fundamentals and proscribe the following 
of codes of conduct. They are generallycounted among the agnostics. They are said 
to be of 24 types. In the eighth sthana (chapter) of Sthanang Sutra eight types of 
akriyavadts have been listed. They are- 
Ekavadi - They have faith in one thing only. Those who deny every other 
thing than that one are all ekavadis (monists) or advaitavadi (non-dualists). Some 
thinkers postulate that everything in this world is based on matter; some others 
believe that shabd (sound) is supreme, and still others that Brahma (the creator God) 
is supreme. 
Anekavadi - They believe that all the constituent parts of a thing have their 
own independent entitative existence. All the available attributes in nature have their 
individual subjects. As their are infinite variations of a thing they believe in multiplicity 
of every single thing. 
Mitavadi - They believe that the universe is confined to the seven continents 
and seas. They consider soul to be a minute entity, at the most, of the size of a 
human thumb, and not enveloping the body or all enveloping. They consider only the 
normally visible beings as living beings and not the minute or invisible organisms. All 
these who have such truncated views about soul are called mitavadi. 
Nirmitavadi - They believe that this world is a creation of some one power or 
the other. This class includes all those who believe in some invisible divine power or 
its conceptual form like Brahma, Vishnu, Mahesh, Devi, etc. as creator, sustainer, 
and destroyer.

Satavadi - Some people believe that the source of happiness is happiness 
itself and the same about sorrow. As a cloth woven with white thread is white, in the 
same way enjoying pleasure will bring pleasure in future as well. Austerities, 
discipline, continence, etc. give pain to body and mind, and therefore they are the 
root cause of sorrow. Such believers in comforts and pleasures to the body and mind 
to be the sources of the ultimate happiness for a being are called satavadi. 
Samucchedavadi - They believe in the ephemeral nature of everything 
including soul and also that with death or destruction comes the final termination of 
their existence. 
Nityavadi - They believe that everything has only one single and stable form 
of existence. There is no growth or decay and nodepletion or destruction. They do 
not consider the existence of a thing to be the consequence of some combination or 
coincidence. They believe in its basic eternality or fundamental stability. According to 
them existent and non-existent are not destroyed and created. Every particle of 
matter is as it was in the remote past and will remain as it is till eternity. 
Na santi parlokvadi - All the thinkers who deny rebirth, the other world, 
liberation, etc. come in this category. They deny the existence of soul; and in 
absence of soul merit and sin, religion and non-religion, good and bad, and this life 
and the next all become nonexistent. There are some who, though believe in 
existence of soul do not believe in spiritual development or purity of soul. Whatever 
happiness or sorrow one gets coincidentally in this world and during this life is all, 
there is nothing beyond that. 
Ajnanavadi - They consider ignorance as the panacea for all sorrows. They 
believe that the sin of an ignorant is no sin. As a child's sins are pardonable because 
of his ignorance, in the same way the god pardons the ignorant for all his sins. A 
crime committed with knowledge deserves punishment, therefore ignorance is 
desirable andbest. These are said to be of 67 types. 
Vinayavadi - They believe that' animals and birds, flowers and leaves, sage 
and ignorant, small and large, all are worth respect and worship. To consider oneself 
to be humbler than the humblest and to respect every one is the means to liberation. 
They are said to be of 32 types.

has twenty three chapters and thirty three udeleshaks and second shrutskandh (part) 
has seven chapters and seven uddeshaks. The first shrutskandh is in verse, only

has a total number of 36 thousand pads (sentence units).

afflictions, the torture of hell beings, attributes of good ascetics, and other such 
topics have been discussed. Also given are the definitions of shraman, Brahman, 
bhikshu, nirgranth, and other such related terms, properly explained with the help of

vehicles are called the Anuttarattpapatik gods. In this sutra are included 33 such 
souls that reincarnated in these vehicles.

chapters, second has 13, and third also has 10. Of the 33 souls described in this, 23 
were the sons of king Shremk. All these great men indulged.in lofty spiritual practices 
during their life time. As a result of this, they earned the karmas that will lead them to 
liberation just after one incarnation as human beings. Besides the inspiring stories of 
their lives, included in this work are procedures ofmany effective spiritual practices 
like - study of shrut, austerities, accepting pratima, tolerating afflictions, ultimate vow,

COMMENTARY -Prashnqvyakaran means questions and answers. In this 
sutra various things have been discussed in the question-answer style. This Agam 
sutra is mainly about the mantras and miraculous capacities connected with various 
gods. When these mantras and special capacities are perfected by following proper 
procedure, information regarding good or bad are acquired. In this work there are 
108 such prashnas which when asked yield this information; 108 which yield this 
information even without asking; and 108 which yield this information on asking as 
well as not asking. 
Besides these, it also contains details about many strange questions, other 
strange miraculous capacities and the divine dialogue of naafi kumars and suparna 
kumars with ascetics. 
The names of the chapters of Prashnavyakaran Sutra, listed in Sthanang 
Sutra vary from those given in Nandi Sutra. At present two shrutskandhas of 
Prashnavyakaran Sutra are available. In the first there is a unique discussion about 
violence, falsity, stealing, lust, and crave for possessions and in the second there is 
a similar discussion about ahimsa, truth, non-stealing, continence, and non-
possession. 
It appears that from this special work on the subject of mantras and 
miraculous powers, the portions dealing with the miraculous capacities have become 
extinct. All that is not available now

12. DRISHTIVAD SHRUT 
[150] MEANING -Question - What is this Drishtivad? 
 
NandiSootra 
 
Aagam- 44 -NandiSootra 
~ 139 ~ 
Compiled by- Deepratnasagar 
 
Answer - In Drishtivad there is validation of subjects form all modes (angles). 
In brief it is of five types - (1) Parikarma, (2) Sutra, (3) Purvagat, (4) Anuyog, and (5) 
Chulika. 
COMMENTARY -The Sanskrit transcription of the original Prakrit word - 
ditthtvaya - is drishtivad or drtshtipat. Here both these appear to be appropriate. 
Drishti itself has numerous meanings - the capacity of eyes to see, the capacity of 
mind to know, opinion, perception, naya (various view points used to know and 
understand meaning), and others. Pat means to throw and vad means to tell, to 
express and also a school of thought (...ism). Thus, this work is basically an 
encyclopedia of philosophy. 
Drishtivad encapsulates all philosophies, the complete storehouse of 
knowledge, and all possible methods of applying naya (view points). This immense 
encyclopedia of knowledge has been compiled in five volumes. 
In Jam tradition this Again is believed to be the greatest among Agarns, but it 
became extinct 1, 500 years back. The volume of this work and the profoundness of 
the knowledge it contained was so great that understanding it and memorizing it was 
a task next to impossible. That is the reason that with passage of time its decline and 
extinction became inevitable. According to the Jain belief Drtshtivad is propagated by 
a Tirthankar and during the period of influence of every Tirthankar it gradually 
depletes with passage of time. The gradual depletion of Drishtivad propagated by 
Bhagavan Mahavir started 300 years after his nirvana and the great work became 
totally extinct a thousand years after his nirvana. 
Whatever little traditional information is available about it, has been mentioned 
here. 
✻ 1. PARiKARMA ✻ 
Question - What is this Parikarma?

Shrenika Parikarma, and (7) Chyutachyut ShrenikaParikarma. 
COMMENTARY -In the subject of mathematics 16 types of parikarmas 
(processes like adding) are mentioned. By studying these one acquires the capacity 
to study mathematics fast and in detail. In the same way these seven parikarmas 
have been provided in Drishtivad. A proper study of these makes it easy to 
understand all the subjects contained within Drishtivad. In other words parikarma is 
the gateway to Drishtivad. 
(1) SIDDHA SHRENIKA PARIKARMA 
Question - What is this Siddha Shrenika Parikarma?

basis of these names one can only imagine about the subject discussed under each 
of them. The name of this parikarma suggest that this must be about perfecting

special', powers. Matrika pad, Ekarthak pad, and Arth pad, could be connected with 
mantras, grammar, and dictionary. Similarly, ; Rashibaddha, Ek Guna, Dviguna, and 
Trtguna must be related toi mathematics. 
(2) MANUSHYA SHRENIKA PARIKARMA 
Question - What is this Manushya ShrenikcParikarma?

Samsar Pratigrah, 13. Nandavart,and 14. Siddhavart. 
This concludes the description of Manushya Shrenika Parikarma. 
COMMENTARY -About Manushya Shrenika Parikarrna it can be surmised 
that it must have contained a stage-wise discussion about various angles of human 
life. For example - Bhavya, Abhavya,, Paritta Samsari, Anant Samsari, Charam 
Shariri, Acharam Sharirt the various levels of human beings reincarnating from 
various dimensions, Samyagdrishti, Mithyadrishti, Mtshradrishti, Aradhak) Viradhak, 
Stri, Purush, Napumsak, Garbhaj, Sammurchhim, Paryaptak, Aparyaptak, Samyat, 
Asamyat, Samyatasamyat, ; Manushya Shrenika, Upasham Shrenika, and Kshapak

7.Ketubhoot, 8.Pratigrah, 9. Samsar Pratigrah, 10. Nandavart,and 11. Prishtavart. 
This concludes the description of Prishta Shrenika Parikarma. 
COMMENTARY -The Sanskrit transcription of the original Prakrit word - 
puttha - is prishta as well as sprtshta. Therefore, this probably contains questions on 
various topics of worldly and other worldly affairs. The alternative word sprishta 
(touching or in contact) also envelopes almost every topic because almost 
everything in this universe touches some other thing. For example - Siddhas touch 
each other, in the gross nigod body there are infinite beings touching each other, 
states of motion and inertia and the space points are touching each other, and so on. 
(4) AVAGADH SHRENIKA PAR1KARMA 
Question - What is this Avagadh Shrenika Partkarma?

COMMENTARY -Avagahana means to occupy space. Akash (space) allows 
occupancy to all substances in its sections or space points. The Avagadh Shrenika,

intimately connected with.

This concludes the description of Up-sampadan Shrenika Parikarma. 
COMMENTARY -Up-sampadan means to receive or to accept. For example - 
sanjamam uvasampajjami or ""I accept discipline."" On the basis of the title it can be 
deduced that this section must be dealing with the act of accepting as well as the 
things and subjects worth accepting. In this context their must also be a detailed 
discussion about the capacities and proportions of the subjects and objects. It may 
also contain details about the things helpful in spiritualpractices. 
(6) VIPRAjAHAT SHRENIKA PARIKARMA

h, 
10.Nandavart,and 
11. 
Viprajahadavart.This concludes the description of Viprajahat Shrenika Parikarma. 
COMMENTARY. - Viprajahat means worth rejecting or that which has to be 
left away. On the basis of the title it may be deduced that this must contain detailed 
discussion about all the things that are worth rejecting. Contact may be beneficial as 
well as harmful. It is better to loose a contact that is harmful. This section deals with 
separation or loosing contact. Therefore it must contain discussions about all those 
things, from numerous angles, that are worth rejecting at some point of time under 
some conditions for some one. 
This indicates that this must contain details about things to be abandoned in 
spiritual, health, and moral context. 
(7) CHYUTACHYUT SHRENIKA PARIKARMA 
Question - What is this Chyutachyut Shrenika Parikarma? 
Answer - Chyutachyut Shrenika Partkarma is said to be of eleven types-1.

Chyutachyutavart. 
This concludes the description of Chyutachyut Shrenika Parikarma.The first 
six parikarmas are based on four nayas and the seventh on Trairashik vaya. 
This concludes the description of parikarma. 
COMMENTARY -It appears that this section must have contained details 
about the Tratrashik School. There are three viewpoints popular in Jain school - 
Samyat, asamyat, and samyatasamyat; diva, ajwa, and jtvajiva; etc. In the same way 
it is possible that in the Trairashik School the terms - chyut, achyut, and chyutachyut 
may have been popular. The concluding sentence of the partkarma section also 
indicates this - ""The first six parikarmas are based on four nayas and the seventh on 
Trairashik nava."" It may also be inferred that the first six parikarmas present Jain 
viewpoint and the seventh that of others (like Trairashik). 
✻ 2. SUTRA✻ 
Question - What is this Sutra? 
Answer - Sutra is said to be of twenty two types-1. Rijusutra, 
2.Parinataparinat, 3.Bahubhangik, 4.Vijayacharit, 5.Anantar, 6.Parampar, 7.Asan, 
8.Samyuth, 9.Sambhinna, 10.Yathavad, 11.Svastikavart, 12.Nandavart, 13.Bahul, 
14.Prishtaprishta, 15.Vyavart, 16. Evambhoot, 17Dvikavart, 18. Vartamanapad, 
 
NandiSootra 
 
Aagam- 44 -NandiSootra 
~ 142 ~ 
Compiled by- Deepratnasagar 
 
19.Samabhiroodh, 20.Sarvatobhadra, 21.Prashishya,and 22. Dushpratigraha.These 
twenty two sutras are of Chhinnachheda nayaaccording to the Jain tradition. The 
same twenty two sutras areof Achhinnachheda naya according to the school of 
AjivakGoshalak. And once again the same twenty two sutras are ofthree nayas 
according to the Trairashik tradition. These same 22Sutras are also of four nayas 
according to the Jain tradition.Thus it is said that including all, the total number of 
sutras is 88. 
This concludes the description of Sutra 
COMMENTARY-Chiunnachheda naya is that where two parts of a statement 
are not dependent on each other for their meaning, they have independent meaning. 
For example - ""Dhammo mangal mukkIttham"" (Dharma is the best among all 
auspicious things). This is an independent statement as far as the meaning is 
concerned. ""Dhammo mangal mukktttham, ahimsa sanjamo tavo"" (That dharma is 
the best among all auspicious things which includes ahimsa, discipline, and 
austerities.) Here the two parts of the statement are dependent on each other for the 
meaning it conveys; this is an example of Achhinnachheda naya. 
This can be inferred that these 22 Sutras have numerous meanings and they 
conceal within them rules about all substances, all modes, all viewpoints, and all 
categories. That is the reason that with reference to different nayas they represent 
different schools of thought, including the Jam as well as others like Abandhak, 
Trairashik, and Ntyativad.

This concludes the description of Purvagat. 
COMMENTARY -It is a Jam belief that when in his first religious discourse a 
Tirthankar addresses the top ranking scholars of that period, a mere utterance of the 
matrika pad (a divine form of sound) evokes the complete shrut-jnana in the inner 
recesses of their mind. After this, on the basis of this knowledge they create the 
Anga scriptures for the benefit of their disciples. They get all this knowledge before 
they create the twelve Anga, therefore it is ca4ed Purvagat (included in the former). 
It is the earlier acquir4d:, knowledge for the Ganadhars, but to the lineage of their 
disciples this profound knowledge is prescribed to be given only after they have 
mastered all the Angas. Another belief is that the knowledge of! the Purvas is 
beyond words. As it can be acquired only by direct! Experience, the only way to 
acquire it is very high level of spiritual practices. 
Inferring on the basis of the above mentioned titles, the commentators (churni 
and vrittl) have provided a list of the probable; - subjects therein- 
Utpad Purva - The origin of all the substances and modes. 
Agrayant Purva - The numbers, quantities, or volumes of all substances, 
modes, and beings. 
Viryapravad Purva - The inherent power and capacity of active or inactive 
beings and non-beings. 
Asti-nastipravad Purva - The existence, non-existence, and relative existence 
or non-existence of substances and modes. 
Jnanapravad Purva - The five types of knowledge and their various divisions. 
Satyapravad Purva - Truth and its types. 
Atmapravad Purva - Soul and its attributes and activities. 
Karmapravad Purva - Karmas, their basic and auxiliary properties along with 
other related topics such as fusion, duration, divisions, sections, etc. 
Pratyakhyanpravad Purva - Pratyakhyan (to expel the acquired thoughts) and 
its categories and sub-categories. 
Vidyanupravad Purva - Special skills and powers and methods of acquiring 
and perfecting them. 
Abandhya Purva - The good and bad fruits of good and bad karmas. 
Pranayu Purva - Age and life. 
Kriyavishal Purva - The activities of beings, and non-beings and the resultant 
inflow of karma. 
Lokabindusar Purva - The drop-like gist of all knowledge, special skills, power, 
attainments, etc. available in the universe.

Mool Prathamanuyog. 
This concludes the description of Mool Prathamanuyog. 
COMMENTARY -The yoga (combination) that is according to the 
fundamentals or the propagated truth is called anuyog. That which compiles 
biographies that conform to the philosophy or principles or are used as example to 
vivify these is named Mool Prathamanuyog. 
Mool Prathamanuyog has complete details of the passage of Tirthankars 
towards purity of soul. It starts with the earlier birth in which the direction of their life 
changed; acquiring samyaktva they proceeded on the path of purification of soul. 
Question - What is this Gandikanuyog? 
Answer - In Gandikanuyog are discussed and propagated - Kulkar Gandika, 
Tirthankar Gandika, Chakravarti Gandika, Dashar Gandika, Baldev Gandika, 
Vasudev Gandika, Ganadhar Gandika, Bhadrabahu Gandika, Tapokarma Gandika, 
Harivamsh Gandika, Utsarpint Gandika, Avasarpini Gandika, -Chitrantar Gandika, 
and births in genuses of gods, human beings, animals, hell beings, etc., cycles of 
rebirth and other such gandikas. 
This concludes the description of Gandikanuyog, this conc]udes the 
description of Anuyog. 
COMMENTARY -Gandika means knot. That in which history is divided, like 
knots in sugar-cane or bamboo, subject-wise, sequence-wise, or period-wise, is 
named Gandikanuyog. As a sugar-cane is divided by knots, if we divide the span of 
time by periods of Tirthankars the intervening periods are filled with the history 
ofnumerous great individuals. Gandikanuyog contains the stories of many past and 
future incarnations of all these. 
5. CHULIKA 
Question - What is this Chulika? 
Answer - The first four Purvas have Chulikas and the remaining is without 
them. 
This concludes the description of Chulika. 
COMMENTARY -Chulika or chula means the peak or pinnacle of a mountain. 
This is generally counted separately from the base and body of a mountain. In the 
same way the extra material, other than the basic text, included in a scripture is 
called Chultka. In other words the extra material related to the basic text and given 
as appendix and/or addendum is called Chulika.

It has descriptions of limited number of mobile beings, and infinite immobile 
beings. Established with the help of shashvat (eternal Sor fundamental), kilt (created 
orexperimented) and natural evidences, the tenets of the Jina have been stated 
(akhyayit), propagated (prajnapit), detailed (prarupit), explained (with the help of 
metaphors) (darshit), clarified (with the help of examples) (nidarshit), and simplified 
(with the help of discourse style) (upadarshit). 
It has been presented in such charan-karan style that if a person is engrossed 
in its studies, he becomes a scholar and an expert of the subject. 
This concludes the description of Drishtivad. 
It appears that Drishtivad is not just a voluminous book. The subject compiled 
in it was numerous and they all were discussed minutely and in great detail. That is 
why the list of its divisions is much longer and more informative as compared with 
that of other shruts. 
These divisions are defined as follows- 
Vastu - larger sections or volumes, Prabhrtt - medium sized sections or parts, 
Prabhrit-prabhrit - smaller sections or chapters, Prabhritikas - longer portions of a 
chapter, Prabhritika-prabhritikas - shorter portions of a chapter, Sangrahani - list of 
subjects given in a few verses, Chulika vastu - sections of a chulika. 
✻BRIEF GIST OF DVADASHANG✻ 
[155] MEANING - The subjects dealt in this Dvadashang Gantpitak are - 
infinite bhava (modes), infinite abhaya (non-modes or absence of modes), infinite 
hetu (causes), infinite ahetu (non-causes), infinite karan (basis), infinite akaran (non-
basis or absence of basis), infinite beings, infinite (non-beings), infinite bhavasiddhik 
(destined to liberate), infinite abhavastddhik (not destined to liberate), infinite 
Siddhas (liberated ones), and infinite asiddha (not liberated). 
[156] MEANING-The sangrahini verse also contains the same list. 
COMMENTARY -This the brief list of the subjects discussed in the twelve 
Angas. Every substance in its natural form is existent, this is bhava. Contrary to this 
is the absence or non-existence of a form other than its natural form or an un-natural 
form, this is abhava.for example a being has presence of the basic attribute of life 
and absence of the basic attribute of non-being. Hetu is the cause thatinspires 
curiosity about the desired subject. Ahetu is its opposite. Karan is the basis of 
acquiring fundamental attributes. For example sand is the upadan karan 
(fundamental basis) of pitcher, and wheel, stick, potter, etc., are its nimitta karan 
(instrumental basis). Akaran is its opposite. Jiva-adiva, Bhavya-abhavya, and 
Siddha-asiddha have already been explained. 
0-BAD CONSEQUENCES OF GOING AGAINST THE DVADASHANG 
[157] MEANING - In the past, going against the Dvadashang or the orders of 
Tirthankar Bhagavan, infinite beings have wandered around in the dense forest of 
cycles of rebirth in four gatis (genuses). 
In the same way, during the present, going against the Dvadashang or the 
orders of Tirthankar Bhagavan, infinite beings wander around in the dense forest of 
cycles of rebirth in four gatis (genuses). 
In the same way, in future, going against the Dvadashang or the orders of 
Tirthankar Bhagavan, infinite beings will wanderaround. in the dense forest of cycles 
of. Rebirth in four gatis (genuses).

COMMENTARY -The truth revealed in the Duadashang for the benefit of the 
worldly beings is called ajna (order). There are said to be three types of ajna - 
sutrajna (text), arthajna (meaning), and ubhayajna (both). The examples of going 
against these are- 
He who, inspired by dogmas and out of ignorance, studies wrong texts, as 
Jamali did, is going against sutrajna. 
He who, inspired by dogmas and out of ignorance, interprets the text wrongly, 
as Goshthamahil did, is going against arthajna. 
He who, lacks faith and mocks both, text and meaning of the Dvadash.ang 
and behaves contrary to it, is going against ubhayajna (both). 
0-GOOD-CONSEQUENCES OF FOLLOWING THE DVADASHANG 
In the past, following the Dvadashang or the orders of Tirthankar Bhagavan, 
infinite beings have crossed the dense forest of cycles of rebirth in four gatis 
(genuses). 
In the same way, during the present, following the Dvadashang or the orders 
of Tirthankar Bhagavan, infinite beings cross the dense forest of cycles of rebirth in 
four gatis (genuses). 
In the same way, in future, following the Dvadashang or the orders of 
Tirthankar Bhagavan, infinite beings will cross the dense forest of cycles of rebirth in 
four gates (genuses). 
COMMENTARY -A dense forest is infested with many dangerous animals, 
other difficulties, and darkness and one needs a bright source of light in order to be 
able to cross it. In the same way, in order to cross the hurdles of cycles of rebirth in 
four gates and the darkness of ignorance infesting this world, one needs the bright 
source of spiritual light that is shrut-jnana. On the path of development of the self 
and others the best guide and help is shrut-jnana. Therefore those desirous of 
liberation should understand the right meaning of this and apply the same in one's 
conduct. This is the only way to get rid of the infection of karmas and finally, this is 
the only means to cross the ocean of mundane existence 
✻THE ETERNALITY OF GANIPITAK✻ 
It is not that the panchastikaya (five fundamental things) did not, do not, and 
will not exist. They did, do, and will exist in the past, present, and future. They are 
firm, defined, eternal, unending, not depleted, fixed, and ever existent. 
In the same way, it is not that the Dvadashang Ganipitak did not, do not, and 
will not exist. They did, do, and will exist in the past, present, and future. They are 
fixed, defined, eternal, unending, not depleted, firm and ever existent. 
In brief, this Dvadashang has been propagated four ways - with reference to 
substance, area, time and modes, as is said- 
With reference to substance a shrutjnani, when intends, sees and knows all 
substances. With reference to area a shrutjnani, when intends, sees and knows all 
areas. With reference to time a shrutjnani, when intends, sees and knows all time. 
With reference to mode a shrutjnani, when intends, sees and knows all modes. 
COMMENTARY -To establish the eternality of Dvadashang from different 
angles adjectives like dhruva have been used. These terms are explained here with 
the help of examples or metaphors- 
Dhruva (firm) - Always immovable like the Meru Mountain.

Niyat (defined) - Being the source of validation of the well defined nine 
fundamentals like diva (being), it is well defined. 
Shashvat (eternal) - As the five fundamental substances are eternal because 
of their being the basis of this creation, so is this Ganipitak. 
Akshaya (unending) - Like the unending flow of the perpetual rivers like the 
Ganges, the flow of the recitation of the Ganges of shrut is unending. 
Avyaya (not depleted) - The immense volume of an ocean is never depleted. 
As the Ganipitak has an immense volume of the inspiration for the path of liberation 
it does not deplete. 
Avasthit-As a continent has fixed dimension and location, so is this Ganipitak. 
Nitya (ever existent) - As the existence of fundamentals like space is ever 
existent, so is that of the Ganipitak. 
✻THE TYPES AND PROCEDURE OF STUDY OF SHRUT-JNANA✻ 
[158] MEANING -There are fourteen types of shrut-jnana - Akshar, Sanjni, 
Samyak, Saadi, Saparyavasit, Gamik and Angapravisht (seven positives); Anakshar, 
Asanjni, Mithya, Anaadi, Aparyavasit, Agamik and Angabahya (seven negatives). 
[159] MEANING -the eight inherent qualities of wisdom that help 
gainscriptural knowledge through study of Agams are defined by theserene and 
scholarly sages of the past as follows- 
[160] MEANING -1.Sushrusha, 2.Pratiprichhana, 3.Shravan, 4.Grahan, 5.Iha, 
6.Apoha, 7.Dharana and 8. Samyak Acharan. 
[161] MEANING -the seven qualities of listening are - be silent whilelistening, 
utter acknowledgment, express acceptance, raisequestions, contemplate, absorb the 
lesson, define the meaning. 
[162] MEANING - The procedure of Anuyog is - first of all recite the text and 
the meaning; after this, mix it with commentaries (niryukti), and thirdly validate it with 
the help of nava and nikshep. 
[163] MEANING-This concludes the description of Angaprauisht shrut. This 
concludes the description of shrut-jnanct. This concludes the description ofparoksh-
jnana. This concludes Nandi Sutra. 
COMMENTARY -Concluding the subject by listing the fourteen types of shrut-
jnana; the author has described the eight qualities of wisdom that help acquiring 
shrut-jnana. The subtle indication here is that, as the qualification of a worthy guru 
lays in the knowledge he has, so does the qualification of a listener or a student in 
these eight qualities. Without ensuring this, imparting of shrut-friana may prove to be 
harmful. It could even be termed as the neglect of shrut. 
Wisdom is the activity of chetana (the activity of soul evident in the activity of 
mind). It absorbs both vices as well as virtues. The wisdom that absorbs virtues is 
qualified and capable of getting shrut-jnana. The Pun; adhar and able sages say that 
the knowledge of Agarris can be acquired only when a student learns ith the help of 
these eight qualities of wisdom near the guru. 
The eight qualities are- 
Sushruha - -To serve the guru with devotion and a desire to listen. To pay 
homage to the guru with devotion before the start of the lesson with an intention to 
acquire knowledge.After this, to express the desire to acquire knowledge. In absence 
of this desire to know it is not possible to acquire knowledge, 
 
NandiSootra 
 
Aagam- 44 -NandiSootra 
~ 148 ~ 
Compiled by- Deepratnasagar 
 
Pratiprichhana - Once the lesson has started and one has listened to the text 
and meaning, to humbly ask questions if there are any doubts. Without removing 
doubts neither the meaning is clear nor is the knowledge perfect. Curiosity is its vital 
ingrediant. 
Shravari - When the guru answers the questions, one should listen attentively. 
If some doubts still remain, one should repeat this process of questioning and 
listening with attention. 
Grahan - To commit to memory the knowledge acquired through the above 
process. 
Iha - To mull over and contemplate the lessons committed to memory so that 
the acquired knowledge becomes the subject of mind. In other words a complete 
command is gained over what has beenlearnt. 
Apoha - To confirm the veracity and authenticity of the knowledge so received 
through analysis. 
Dharana - After authentication, commit the essence of the acquired 
knowledge to long term memory. 
Samyak Acharan - The essence of knowledge is conduct. The listened and 
memorized knowledge is transformed into conduct through right practices. Only 
when this is done, it becomes capable of destroying the karmas and leading to 
liberation. The ultimate quality of wisdom is to translate knowledge into right conduct. 
The procedure of listening 
In the fourth verse is given the process of listening from the teachers. Sit 
before the guru on a proper seat and in a humble posture with joined palms. When 
the guru gives his discourse the student should humbly behave in the following 
manner- 
Mooam - When the guru speaks, the student should silently listen with rapt 
attention. 
Hunkar - In between the student should utter word of acknowledgment. 
Badhankar - In between, at appropriate junctures the student should 
respectfully say - Gurudev, indeed, what you say is true and factual. 
Padipucchai - In between, the student should ask questions to remove his 
doubts as and when any need arises. 
Mimansa - He should think over the words the guru has uttered and the 
meaning they convey. 
Prasang Parayan - Repeating this process the student absorbs shrut and 
gradually becomes an expert. 
Parinitthia - Acquiring the knowledge from the guru this way, he continues to 
contemplate over it and acquires the capability of propagating the principles 
contained within it. 
Therefore, those desirous of acquiring knowledge should listen to the 
scriptures from the guru following the said procedure. 
 
The procedure of reciting the text and meaning 
5th verse - The scholarly acharyas and upadhyayas should follow this 
sequence while reciting a sutra before discipls- 
Sutrarth - First teach the student the correct communciationof the sutra. After 
that, explain him the meaning.

Aagam- 44 -NandiSootra

Nijiutti - After that he should parse and define the words of the Agam and 
explain their meaning. 
After this he should explain the detailed meaning of the sutra. Elaborate it with 
the help of various processes of logic, view points, validations, and examples. This 
way he should give complete and in-depth knowledge to his student and make him 
an expert of shrut. 
Thus ends the description of the angapravisht shrut-jnana and within that the 
description of Paroksh-jnana.

◙ Something about This Publication ◙ 
 
We have already published 45 Aagams in Four languages Prakrut, Sanskrut 
(Satik), Hindi and Gujarati.  Now a day for new generation & abroad living people, 
English translation has become a necessity.  So we have planned to translate or 
compile Jain-Aagam in English. We gave priority to Nandi Sootra because it’s 
known as wellbeing & auspicious sootra. The Theme of Nandi is knowledge; 
Nandi-sootra mainly describes five types of “ान-(Jnanas)”.  
After that we have started Niraayavalika panchak, from that panchak, 
here we are giving meaning with commentary of Pushpachulika. 
Pushpachulika is an “Ang-bahya”Aagam, at present it is known as “Upang” 
Sootra. Shree Chandra-Suri has written Vrutti [commentary] on this Aagam 
Here, we have compiled Translation done by Surendra Bothara, which is 
originally edited in to Hindi by Shree Am ar-Muni & Shree Chandra Surana, We 
have  two motives for publishing this book.—[1] To provide Aagam literature in 
English & [2] It should be given in Microsoft Word format so people can do Cut, 
Paste & Editing by themselves also. 
At present this Book is published as a Net-Publication with the help of the 
Jain Education International organization of America.  In future we may publish it 
as a Book also. We are also planning to put more Aagams in English before you. 
We also invite learned persons to translate more & more ‘authentic Jain 
literature in English for kids and youths, so the ignorant-people of regional 
languages can also read or learn our “Shashtra & Granth”. 
We are very much thankful to Shree Pravinbhai, Sudeshbhai, Late Mr. 
Krupal Shah and all other known-unknown persons who helped us for this project 
directly or indirectly.

   Aagam – 22 – Pushpachulika                         Compiled by - Deepratnasagar 
 
 
Φ Introduction:- 
There are ten chapters in this fourth section titled Pushpachulika. The central 
characters of these chapters are ten goddesses. They got initiated by Pushpachulika  
Aryaa during the period of influence of Purushadaniya ParshvaNaath. After getting 
initiated they neglected their spiritual grandeur by getting over indulgent in physical 
grandeur like apparels and other adornments of the body. In spite of the advise of 
their teacher they did not refrain from their anti-ascetic conduct. They also did not 
atone for these sinful acts committed by them by doing critical review (pratikraman). 
That was the reason they became transgressors of the ascetic conduct. Later, like 
Bahuputrika Devi, they came to Bhagavan in the Samavasaran (the divine assembly of 
a Tirthankar) and displayed their divine opulence. After this Bhagavan Mahavir told 
the stories of their past births to satisfy GautamSwami's curiosity. 
Central theme of these ten chapters is that ascetics who take vow of celibacy 
after renouncing mundane pleasures and comforts should not have so much fondness 
and involvement with the body that they spend all their time in its embellishment and 
neglect their primary duty of meditation, studies and pursuit of knowledge. The feeling 
of attachment for body and involvement in its embellishment is termed as `bakushika' 
here. The meaning of this term is—the attitude that spoils ascetic-discipline. 
Another message is that one should essentially atone for the faults and 
transgressions in observing ascetic-discipline committed due to stupor or mundane 
attachments. One who does not atone for his faults becomes transgressor of the ascetic 
discipline and conduct. As a consequence he does not get reincarnated in the expected 
higher divine realm after death. These stories also inform us about how liberal and 
open-minded was Bhagavan Parshva Nath, the epitome of compassion. By inspiring 
spinsters of advanced age, leading a neglectful and wretched life, to take to the spiritual 
path he provided them a place of honour and respect in the society. 
All these chapters have almost the same story line.

   Aagam – 22 – Pushpachulika                         Compiled by - Deepratnasagar 
                                                                                                          Gunasheelak. 
The ruler of the city was King Shrenik. Once Swami (Shraman Bhagavan Mahavir) 
arrived. People came to attend his religious discourse. 
During that period of time Shri Devi was sitting on a throne named Shri in the 
Sudharma Sabha (divine assembly) of the Shri Avatansak Vimaan (celestial vehicle) in 
Saudharm Kalp (divine dimension) along with four thousand vehicle based goddesses 
and four thousand Mahattarika goddesses (teacher goddesses who taught ethics and 
morality). Like Bahuputrika Devi, she saw Shraman Bhagavan Mahavir stationed in 
Rajagriha. She came there, presented stage performance and returned. The only 
difference was that she did not create children during her dance performance (like 
Bahuputrika had done). 
When Shri Devi left, Gautam Swami asked Bhagavan Mahavir about her past 
birth. Bhagavan replied- ""Gautam ! During that period of time there was a city named 
Rajagriha. There was a chaitya named Gunasheelak. The ruler was King Jitshatru. 
In Rajagriha lived a gathapati (householder) named Sudarshan who was very rich. 
The name of Sudarshan Gathapati's wife was Priya. She had very delicate limbs and 
was very beautiful. Sudarshan Gathapati and Priya Gathapatni had a daughter 
named Bhoota. As she grew old without getting married she appeared to be an old 
spinster with a frail and decrepit body. Her buttocks and breasts hid become loose 
and infirm but being unmarried and untouched by man she was still chaste. 
During that period of time nine cubits tall Purushadaniya Arhat Parshva 
arrived (in the city). People came out to pay homage to him. 
Getting this news Bhoota Darika (Miss Bhoota) was pleased and delighted. She 
went to her parents and sought permission—""O mother and father! During his 
wanderings Purushadaniya Arhat Parshva arrived here. He now stays here with his 
family of disciples. 0 parents ! After getting your permission I want to go to worship 
Purushadaniya Arhat Parshva's feet."" 
The parents said—""Beloved of gods ! Do as you please and avoid languor 
when doing a good deed.""After getting permission from her parents Bhoota Darika 
took her bath, dressed and adorned herself with ornaments. She came out of her 
house with many friends and maids came to the outer hall and boarded her chariot 
assigned for religious activities. 
Accompanied by her friends and relatives, Bhoota Darika passed through 
Champa city and arrived near Gunasheelak Chaitya. She alighted from the chariot 
when she saw the divine canopy and other divine signs of a Tirthankar. Surrounded 
by her maids, she approached the spot where Purushadaniya Arhat Parshva was 
seated. She went around Bhagavan three times, paid homage and obeisance and 
commenced worship with reverence. 
Purushadaniya Arhat Parshva gave his discourse to the large gathering 
including Bhoota Darika. On listening to and understanding the sermon she was 
pleased. Later Bhoota Darika paid homage and obeisance to Bhaga van and 
conveyed her feelings—""Bhagavan ! I have faith in the Nirgranth-sermon propagated 
by you. I am prepared to accept this sermon. It is exactly as you have stated (it is the 
ultimate truth and reality). Bhante ! I would like to get initiated, but first let me seek 
permission from my parents. 
Arhat Parshva said—""Beloved of gods ! Do as you please and avoid languor 
when doing a good deed.""

***** 
 (After paying homage to Bhagavan) Bhoota Darika rode the same religious-chariot 
and passing through Rajagriha city returned home. She got down from the chariot and 
went to her parents. Like Jamali (See- Bhagavati Sutra), she joined her palms and sought 
permission for initiation from her parents. Giving permission her parents said—""Beloved 
of gods ! Do as you please and avoid languor when doing a good deed."" 
After that Sudarshan Gathapati arranged for (by instructing his servants) large 
quantities of staple food, liquids, general food, and savory food and invited all his friends, 
kin-folk, family members, relatives and acquaintances. After feeding them he greeted and 
honoured them. After Bhoota performed her ritual cleansing, Sudarshan called his 
servants for the renunciation ceremony and instructed- ""Beloved of gods ! Bring at once a 
large palanquin carried by one thousand men and inform me as soon as you do that."" 
The servants did as asked and informed. 
Sudarshan Gathapati then let Bhoota Darika, who had already taken her bath 
and adorned herself with ornaments, ride the palanquin carried by one thousand 
persons. Amidst the sound of musical instruments like trumpet and surrounded by 
friends, kin-folk, family members, relatives and acquaintances he arrived, passing 
through Rajagriha city, at Gunasheelak Chaitya. When he saw the divine canopy and 
other divine signs of a Tirthankar, he stopped palanquin and let Bhoota alight from it. 
Then the parents escorted Bhoota Darika to the place where Purushadaniya Arhat 
Parshva was seated. After going around Bhagavan three times and paying homage and 
obeisance they submitted—""Beloved of gods ! This is our only daughter Bhoota,d we love 
her very much. But, O Beloved of gods ! Disturbed by the fears of worldly existence, she 
now wants to renounce the world and get initiated by you. Therefore, 0 Beloved of gods! 
We offer her to you as a disciple-donation. Kindly accept this disciple-donation. 
Purushadaniya Arhat Parshva said—""Beloved of gods ! Do as you please."" 
Bhoota Darika was pleased and contented to hear these words from 
Purushadaniya Arhat Parshva. She went in the north-eastern direction (ishan Kone) 
and discarded her householder's dress and ornaments. All this description should be 
taken exactly as mentioned about Devananda (See- Bhagavati Sutra). After initiating 
her, Purushadaniya Arhat Parshva handed her over to Aryaa Pushpachulika as her 
disciple. She studied under Aryaa Pushpachulika and became a completely celibate 
aryaa (female ascetic). 
Some time after her initiation, that Bhoota Aryika became sharir-bakushika (a 
woman having an attitude that spoils ascetic-discipline as a consequence of over indulgence in 
beautification of the body). She would wash her limbs, head, face, cleavage, armpits and 
genitals many times. Before standing, sleeping, meditating or studying anywhere she 
would sprinkle water over the ground she used for these activities. 
When Aryaa Pushpachulika saw all this she warned Bhoota Aryika—""Beloved 
of gods ! we are Nirgranth Shramanis (Jain female ascetics) cleansing our inner 
perversions with five samitis (regulations) including the Irya samiti (regulation of 
movement) and are strictly celibate. As such, we are not allowed to be sharir-
bakushika (over indulgent in beautification of the body). But as you have become sharir-
bakushika and are washing your limbs, head,... and so on up to... sprinkle water over 
the ground you use for sitting, standing, sleeping and studies you should do critical 
review and the prescribed atonement for this action."" Further details should be taken 
as those mentioned about Subhadra Aryaa. But Bhoota Aryika (neither believed nor

*****                                                                                                                      
accepted these instructions and directions of Aryaa Pushpachulika) left the upashraya 
(place of stay for ascetics) and shifted to another suitable abode. 
This way that Bhoota Aryika washed her limbs and took extra care of her body 
without any qualms and restrictions. She became antinomian and adamantly 
pursued her anti-ascetic way of life. 
This way observing two-day fasts, three day fasts and other austerities, that 
Bhoota Aryika lived for a long time as an ascetic. in the end she died without 
reviewing and atoning for her misconduct. She reincarnated instantaneously 
(upapat) as Shri Devi, a goddess with suitable body size, in the divine bed covered 
with divine cloth in the Upapat-hall of Shri Avatansak Viman (celestial vehicle) in 
Saudharma Kalp (divine dimension). There she attained the state of full development 
(paryapti) through bhasha-man (speech and mind) paryapti. 
Thus, Gautam ! Shri Devi acquired that divine opulence. Her life-span there is 
one Palyopam. 
Gautam—""Bhante ! Completing the age, state, and life in the dimension of 
gods where will that Shri Devi go ? (Where will she be born?)"" 
Bhagavan said, ""Gautam ! She will be born as a human being in the 
Mahavideh area and (after observing strict ascetic-discipline) shall finally become a 
Siddha (liberated soul)."" 
In conclusion SudharmaSwami said- "" Long lived Jambu ! Bhagavan Mahavir 
has narrated this text and meaning of first chapter of Pushpachulika. So I state."" 
 
 
 
Arya Sudharma Swami said- “Remaining nine chapters should also be narrated in 
the same way. They all got initiated and after death reincarnated in celestial vehicles 
bearing each one's name. For example—Hridevi in Hri Viman in Saudharma Kalp, Dhritidevi 
in Dhriti Viman, Kirtidevi in Kirti Viman, Buddhidevi in Buddhi Viman and so on. 
 Their past births are also same as that of Bhoota. Names of the city, chaitya 
parents, and their own names should be taken as mentioned in the Sangrahini Gatha 
(collective verse). However, this collective verse is not available in any text. They all got 
initiated by Arhat Parshva and became disciples of Pushpachula Aryaa. They all 
became sharir-bakushikas (over indulgent in beautification of the body), died without 
critical review and atonement, and reincarnated in divine dimension. Descending from 
the divine dimension they all will be born in the Mahavideh area and finally attain 
enlightenment and liberation (Siddha-buddha).""

◙ Something about This Publication ◙ 
 
We have already published 45 Aagams in Four languages Prakrut, Sanskrut 
(Satik), Hindi and Gujarati.  Now a day for new generation & abroad living people, 
English translation has become a necessity.  So we have planned to translate or 
compile Jain-Aagam in English. We gave priority to Nandi Sootra because it’s 
known as wellbeing & auspicious sootra. The Theme of Nandi is knowledge; 
Nandi-sootra mainly describes five types of “ान-(Jnanas)”.  
After that we have finished Niraayavalika panchak [UpangSootra-19 to 23] 
and vipakshrut [Angsootra- 11]  All these six Aagamas are related with Stories. 
Now we are going to translate a Prakirnak-Sootra Named  VEERSTAVA, in 
which Sootrakaar-Maharshi has narrated  glorifications of jineshwar Mahaveer                        
by 26-  praising words. We didn’t find any type of commentaries regarding this 
Aagam . So we have just given a brief detail of these glorified words.  
Prakirnak-Sootra:-- In ancient times all the Aagams were divided in to two 
categories, Angpravishtha and Angbaahya. Angpravistha includes 12 Aagams  & 
All the other Aagams were included in to Aangbaahya. After 13th centuary these 
Aagams were devided in the different style. Now a days as per ‘Shwetamber” 
belief they are presented in six parts- Ang, Upang, Prakirnak, Chhed, Mool and 
Chulika.  The mentioned Prakirnak “VEERSTAVA” is known as 10th prakirnak, in 
alternative of “MARANSAMAADHI” Prakirnak.                              
Here, we have compiled Translation done by Colonel D.S. Baya, which is 
originally edited in to Hindi by Dr. subhash Kothari, We have  two motives for 
publishing this book.—[1] To provide Aagam literature in English & [2] It should be 
given in Microsoft Word format so people can do Cut, Paste & Editing by 
themselves also. 
At present this Book is published as a Net-Publication with the help of the 
Jain Education International organization of America.  In future we may publish it 
as a Book also. We are also planning to put more Aagams in English before you. 
We also invite learned persons to translate more & more ‘authentic Jain 
literature in English for kids and youths, so the ignorant-people of regional 
languages can also read or learn our “Shashtra & Granth”. 
We are very much thankful to Shree Pravinbhai, Sudeshbhai, Sangeetaben, 
Late Mr. Krupal Shah and all other known-unknown persons who helped us for this 
project directly or indirectly. 
                                                                           
                                                                              
                                                     Dharm-Labh 
                                                                 Muni deepratnasagar

◙ Something about This Publication ◙ 
We have already published 45 Aagams in Four languages Prakrut, Sanskrut 
(Satik), Hindi and Gujarati.  Now a day for new generation & abroad living people, 
English translation has become a necessity.  So we have planned to translate or 
compile Jain-Aagam in English. We gave priority to Nandi Sootra because it’s 
known as wellbeing & auspicious sutra. The Theme of Nandi is knowledge; Nandi-
sootra mainly describes five types of “ान-(Jnanas)”.  
After that we have finished Niraayavalika panchak [UpangSootra-19 to 23] 
Antkrud-Dasha, Anuttarop-patik-Dasha, Vipaak-Shrut [Ang Sootra- 8, 9 & 11], we 
have already published VeerStava [Parking – 10]. Thus we have Published 10 
Aagams till yet. 
Now we are going to translate a Prakirnak-Sootra Named Gachchhachar, 
in which Sootrakaar-Maharshi has narrated glorifications of Cod & Conduct of 
Gachchh- [Gan, Acharya, Monks, Nuns, Etc.] Though it’s commentary by Shree 
Vanrshi Gani is also there in Sanskrit, but we have just given a brief detail of these 
glorified words.  
Prakirnak-Sootra:-- In ancient times all the Aagams were divided in to two 
categories, Angpravishtha and Angbaahya. Angpravishtha includes 12 Aagams  & 
All the other Aagams were included in to Angbaahya. After 13th centaury these 
Aagams were divided in the different style. Now a days as per ‘Shwetambar” belief 
they are presented in six parts- Ang, Upang, Prakirnak, Chhed, Mool and Chulika.  
The mentioned Prakirnak “Gachchhachar” is known as 7th Prakirnak, in alternative 
of “Chandravedhyak” Prakirnak.                              
Here, we have compiled Translation done by Colonel D.S. Baya, which is 
originally edited in to Hindi by Dr. Suresh Sisodiya, Original text of Gachchhachar 
is edited by me [Muni Deepratnasagar], which was based on four Publications—
Original sutra edited by shree SagaraAnandsuriji, by shree Punyavijayji, and two 
commentaries on Gachchhachar Prakirnak.   We have  two motives for publishing 
this book.—[1] To provide Aagam literature in English & [2] It should be given in 
Microsoft Word format so people can do Cut, Paste & Editing by themselves also. 
At present this Book is published as a Net-Publication with the help of the 
Jain Education International organization of America.  In future we may publish it 
as a Book also. We are also planning to put more Aagams in English before you. 
We also invite learned persons to translate more & more ‘authentic Jain 
literature in English for kids and youths, so the ignorant-people of regional 
languages can also read or learn our “Shashtra & Granth”. 
We are very much thankful to Shree Pravinbhai, and all other known-
unknown persons who helped us for this project directly or indirectly. 
                                                                           
                                                                             Dharm-Labh 
                                                                 Muni Deepratnasagar 
                                                               (11/04/2014) 
 
 
 
 
 
 
[4] 
 
 
 
 
[Gachchhachar is a seventh Prakirnak and its number in 45 Aagams is 30.Here we 
have given its number 30/1 because in our former publications of 45 Aagams in Sanskrut, 
Prakrut, Hindi, Gujarati etc…everywhere we have given these types of numbers. We have 
put “Chandravedhyak” as 30/2 number.]

monastic group for any length of time – half a Prahara, a Prahar (a Period of 
approximately three hours), a day, a fortnight, a month, or a year – is that even if one is 
beset with lethargy, pride lack of enthusiasm or sadness, he is enthused and motivated 
to enthusiastically by seeing other noble and glorious monks in the group. One is, thus, 
able to transcend sham, doubt, etc and get involved in the pursuit of one’s monastic 
duties vigorously. 
 
[6] Meaning- O’ Gautam! The moment an aspirant soul is gripped by vigorous 
spiritual energy, it is able to destroy the heap of karma accumulated over many a birth in

sure of this before joining the monastic group.

Acharya is on the wrong path? O’ Monk! Pray listen to me about this. 
 
[10-11] Meaning- The Acharya who follow arbitrary conduct, are unrighteous 
engaged in violent activities, are comfort loving and are careless in preserving water-
borne life. Who have deviated from their primary and secondary virtues, who do not 
confess and repent for their excesses and transgressions everyday and who are always 
engaged in spiritually useless talk are said to be on the wrong path. 
 
[12] Meaning- Even for master endowed with thirty-six virtues of Acharya It is 
best to confess and repent for his excesses and transgressions in front of other 
members of the monastic group every day.

monk who is devoid of desire to seek the supreme accomplishment, for such monks only 
lead one to bad destinies.

immediately and without an exception, even though they may be as bitter as the most 
potent poison. For, such words are, in essence, not poison but nectar. They (the learned 
masters) are harmless, don’t kill and even if one dies in the process of obeying them, 
one become immortal.  
 
[46-47] Meaning- The words of the canon-ignorant (Acharya) mustn’t be 
accepted under any circumstances, even though they may be as sweet as the nectars. 
For, such words are, in essence, not nectar but like the most potent poison. By

immediately and never liberates oneself from the eternal cycle of births and deaths.

Gachchhachar-Prakirnak-7/1- Gatha-39 
 
 
 
 
 
[8]

forgiving sense-conquered protector of the self (virtues) and the others’ and remains 
engaged in the pursuit of the detached monastic path. He observes tenfold monastic 
codes and restrains him to the observance of essential monastic practices. 
 
[54-55] Meaning- That monastic group is the real monastic group where the 
disciples do not envy, where they do not condemn the guru even when they are at the 
end of their tether, where they do not defame the group, where they do not do anything 
undoable and do not decry the precepts preached by the Lord Jinas. Even when they 
are exited from the group by the guru after seven tongue lashing and harshly worded 
admonitions.

guru by uttering ‘taha-tti’ (it is so, O Master).

and pots but he is also detached from his own body. He is able to avoid forty two flaws

carrying the load of his monastic responsibilities just as the cart-axle carries its (the 
cart’s) entire weight. 
 
[59] Meaning- The six reasons for which a monk takes food are:- (1) To mitigate 
the pangs of hunger, (2) To serve his guru, (3) To be able to undertake monastic 
peregrinations, (4) To properly observe monasticism, (5)To keep alive and (6) To 
practice (by undertaking pious contemplation) and propagate the faith. 
 
 
[60] Meaning- O’ Gautam! That monastic group is the real monastic group where 
the distinction of the elders and the juniors is properly maintained, the elders are bowed 
to and venerated, so much so that someone even a day senior in monastic hierarchy, is 
not flouted. 
 
[61] Meaning- Gautam! Monastic group in which the monks do not thoughtlessly 
accept the food brought by the nuns even when there is a danger to their lives, due to 
severe famine, is the real monastic group. 
 
[62] Meaning- The monastic groups in which very old toothless monks also do 
not look at the ladies’ physiology and do not indulge in loose talk with the nuns is the real 
monastic group. 
 
[63] Meaning- O’ Vigilant monks! Consider the contact with the nuns as 
forbidden as the contact with fire and poison. The monk that maintains contact with them 
soon earns defamation. 
 
[64] Meaning- Even if an old, austere, canon-learned and true monk keeps the 
company of the nuns, he certainly earns a bad name. 
 
[65] Meaning- will a young and ordinary monk not undertaking severe penance --

monk will certainly earn a bad name. 
 
[66] Meaning- Even if a monk is of stable mind, his inner self melts (his thoughts

◙ Something about This Publication ◙ 
 
We have already published 45 Aagams in Four languages Prakrut, Sanskrut 
(Satik), Hindi and Gujarati.  Now a day for new generation & abroad living people, 
English translation has become a necessity.  So we have planned to translate or 
compile Jain-Aagam in English. We gave priority to Nandi Sootra because it’s known 
as wellbeing & auspicious sootra. The Theme of Nandi is knowledge; Nandi-sootra 
mainly describes five types of “ान-(Jnanas)”.  
 
After that we have started Niraayavalika panchak, from that panchak, 
here we are giving meaning with commentary of Vrushnidasha 
 
Vrushnidasha is an “Ang-bahya”Aagam, at present it is known as “Upang” 
Sootra. Shree Chandra-Suri has written Vrutti [commentary] on This Aagam. 
 
Here, we have compiled Translation done by Surendra Bothara, which is 
originally edited in to Hindi by Shree Am ar-Muni & Shree Chandra Surana, We have  
two motives for publishing this book.—[1] To provide Aagam literature in English & [2] 
It should be given in Microsoft Word format so people can do Cut, Paste & Editing by 
themselves also. 
 
At present this Book is published as a Net-Publication with the help of the Jain 
Education International organization of America.  In future we may publish it as a 
Book also. We are also planning to put more Aagams in English before you. 
 
We also invite learned persons to translate more & more ‘authentic Jain 
literature in English for kids and youths, so the ignorant-people of regional languages 
can also read or learn our “Shashtra & Granth”. 
 
We are very much thankful to Shree Pravinbhai, Sudeshbhai, Late Mr. Krupal 
Shah and all other known-unknown persons who helpd us for this project directly or 
indirectly. 
                                                                           
                                                                               Dharm-Labh

◙   INTRODUCTION:- 
The name of the fifth section of this Upanga is Vahnidasa or Vrushnidasha.Now-
a-days this Aagam is known as twelth upang. In the commentary (Churni) of Nandi 
Sutra it is mentioned as Andhak Vrushnidasha. It contains stories of twelve princes of 
the Vrushni clan. The first and second sections of this Upanga contain stories of princes 
born during the period of Bhagavan Mahavir. The third and fourth sections contain 
stories of princes born during the period of Purushadaniya Arhat Parshvanaath. And this 
fifth section contains the stories of the aspirants of the period of Arhat Arishtanemi. 
In the stories of all the five sections there is an evidence of a progressive 
ascent. In Niryavaliya, the first section, there are stories of ten souls reincarnating in 
the infernal world. This is followed by stories of souls reincarnating in the Saudharm 
Kalp and Jyotishk Vimans in Kalpavatansika, Pushpika and Pushpachulika sections. In 
the fifth section titled Vrishnidasha are the stories of souls reincarnating in the Sarvarth 
Siddha Viman of Anuttar dimension. Thus the stories of progressive development and 
ascent provide inspiration to pursue the path of progressive purity and ascent of soul. 
 
 
[1] Meaning- (Jambu Swami asked Sudharma Swami-) ""Bhante! When aforesaid is 
the text and meaning of the fourth section of the Upanga named Pushpachulika as 
given by Shraman Bhagavan Mahavir, who has attained nirvana, what is the text and 
meaning of the fifth section of the Upanga named Vrishnidasha?""

and (12) Shatadhanva. 
[3] Meaning- Jambu- ""Bhante! If there are twelve chapters in Vrishnidasha, the 
fifth Upanga (section), as given by Shraman Bhagavan Mahavir, what is the text and 
meaning of its first chapter?"" 
Jambu ! During that period of time (when Bhagavan Arishtanemi lived) there was a city 
called Dwaravati (Dwarika). It was spread in an area measuring twelve Yojan (an ancient 
measure of distance) east-west and nine Yojan north-south. In other words it was nine Yojan 
wide and twelve Yojan long. Its inhabitants were rich and charming. Like a divine city it was 
delightful, beautiful and unique in architecture and sculpture. 
There was a lofty mountain range with sky-high peaks outside Dvaravati city in the 
north-east direction. It’s enchanting lush greenery included a variety of trees, shrubs, 
bushes, vines, creepers, etc. The mountain resonated with the sounds of a variety of 
animals and birds including swans, deer, peacocks, Kraunch ( Demoiselle crane), Sarus

were numerous banks of rivers and streams. At some places there were large plateaus 
and at others there were caves. Water-falls, lofty peaks and projections too added to its 
beauty. A variety of divine couples lead by Apsaras, Charans, and Vidyadhars always 
indulged in group festivities there. Ten great warriors from the Dashar clan including 
Samudravijaya frequently organized a variety of celebrations and festivities there. That 
mountain range was tranquil, serene, beautiful, enchanting, delightful and attractive. 
Neither very far nor very near that Raivatak mountain was a garden named 
Nandanvan. It was filled with all season flowering trees and was as beautiful as Nandan 
Kanan (the divine garden). 
At the center of this garden was an ancient temple of Surapriya Yaksh. Many of 
people visited this temple for the worship of Surapriya Yaksh.Like Purnabhadra Chaitya 
this Surapriya Yaksh temple was also surrounded by a garden at the center of which 
was a large flat rock. (The description is same as mentioned in Aupapatik Sutra) 
   In the city of Dvaravati lived King Krishna Vasudev. The details of the people 
under his reign are—the ten Dashar kings lead by Samudravijaya, five great warriors lead 
by Baldev, sixteen thousand kings lead by Ugrasen, thirty five million princes lead by 
Pradyumna, sixty thousand fiery warriors lead by Shamb, twenty one thousand great 
soldiers lead by Virsen, thirty two thousand queens lead by Rukmini, thousands of 
courtesans lead by Anangasena and a multitude of regional kings, influential and rich 
persons, knights of honour, landlords, heads of large families, affluent people, established 
merchants, commanders, caravan chiefs, etc. His empire extended from the Vaitadhya 
mountain in the north to the Lavana sea in the three remaining directions. He ruled this 
large land mass known as Dakshinardha Bharat ably with all his power and grandeur. 
In the same Dvaravati city lived King Baladev, the elder brother of Shri krishna 
Vasudev. He was also very powerful and looked after the security of the state. 
Name of King Baldev's wife was Revati Devi who was very delicate and beautiful. 
Once Revati Devi saw a lion in her dream when she was sleeping in her bed in 
the royal bedroom. She got up and went to her husband. King Baldev interpreted the 
dream. In the morning augurs were called. In due course a son was born. He was 
named Nishadh. When the boy was eight years old he studied seventy two arts 
(subjects) like Mahabal. At the time of his marriage he was given fifty sets of gifts as 
dowry. He was married to fifty princesses at the same time. All these details should be 
taken exactly as mentioned about Mahabal. He lived happily enjoying worldly pleasures 
and comforts in his lofty mansion. 
During that period of time Arhat Arishtanemi arrived in Dvaravati city. He was the 
propagator of religion. He was ten Dhanush (an ancient linear measure) tall. People came 
to attend his discourse. 
When Krishna Vasudev heard the news of Arhat Arishtanemi's arrival he was 
pleased and contented. He called his attendants and said, ""Beloved of gods ! Rush to the 
Sudharma assembly hall, blow Samudanik trumpet (on hearing which people start gathering). 
The attendants accepted Krishna Vasudev's order and blew the Samudanik 
trumpet loudly in the Sudharma assembly.

Hearing the reverberating echo of the Samudanik trumpet the ten Dashar kings lead 
by Samudravijaya, Rukmini and other queens, thousands of courtesans lead by 
Anangasena and a multitude of regional kings, influential and rich persons,... and so on up 
to... caravan chiefs (etc.) took their bath, performed auspicious rituals, and got ready 
adorning themselves with a variety of ornaments. They came to Krishna Vasudev riding 
elephant, horse, and other carriers according to each one's status. Many of them arrived 
even walking. They joined their palms and greeted Krishna Vasudev with hails of victory. 
After this Krishna Vasudev called his servants and ordered—""Beloved of gods! Get 
my best elephant duly decorated and ready. Order four pronged armed forces comprising of 
horse riders, elephant riders, charioteers and foot soldiers to be ready to march,Report back."" 
Krishna Vasudev entered his bathroom, took his bath, dressed and embellished 
himself with ornaments. Once ready, he rode the elephant and left. Lead by eight 
auspicious things and accompanied by ten Dashar kings lead by Samudravijaya,... and so 
on up to... caravan chiefs (etc.) and with all his glory and grandeur... and so on up to... 
amidst the loud sound of musical instruments he came to Arhat Arishtanemi passing 
through Dvaravati city. After performing due obeisance he worshipped Tirthankar. All this 
description follows the same as that mentionec in Aupapatik in context of King Kunik. 
At that time Prince Nishadh was in his lofty mansion. When he saw tumultuous 
crowd, he became curious. Like Jamali, he also came out of his mansion with all his 
grandeur and opulence. He came to Bhagavan's Samavasaran, paid homage and 
obeisance, listened to the discourse and understood it. He once again paid homage to 
Bhagavan and said""Bhante! I have faith in Nirgranth-pravachan (Tirthankar's sermon)."" 
Like Chitta Sarathi, he accepted the Shravak Dharma (code for laity) and returned home. 
During that period of time Anagaar (ascetic) Varadatt was the principal disciple of 
Arhat Arishtanemi. When Varadatt Anagar saw Prince Nishadh he was curious. While 
worshiping he asked Arhat Arishtanemi—""Bhante! This Prince Nishadh is beloved (of all) 
having lovable appearance, attractive having attractive appearance, adorable having 
adorable appearance, enchanting having enchanting appearance, serene having serene 
appearance, good-looking, and pretty. Bhante ! How this Prince Nishadh got and availed 
this human opulence?"" As Gautam Swami had asked about SuryabhDev, likewise 
Varadatt Anagar asked Arhat Arishtanemi (about Prince Nishadh). 
Arhat Arishtanemi replied—""Long lived Varadatt ! During that period of time in 
Bharat area of this Jambudveep continent there was a city named Rohitak. It was very 
prosperous. There was a garden named Meghavan in that city. In the garden there was 
the temple of Manidatt Yaksh. The name of the ruler of Rohitak city was King Mahabal. 
The name of his consort was queen Padmavati. 
One night Padmavati was sleeping comfortably in her bed when she saw a lion in 
her dream. The description up to the birth of a son should be read as mentioned about 
Mahabal. Mahabal's son was named Virangad. When he matured he married to thirty 
two princesses and was given sets of thirty two things in dowry. He spent his life happily 
in lofty palaces enjoying mundane pleasures gratifying all five sense organs of hearing, 
touch, taste, vision, and smell suitable for all the six seasons namely, pavas, varsha 
(monsoon), sharad (autumn), hemant (winter), greeshma (summer), and vasant (spring).

During that period of time lived Acharya Siddharth, who was as accomplished a 
scholar as Keshi Shraman but just short of four kinds of knowledge. He arrived with his 
large family of disciples at the temple of Manidatt Yaksh in Meghavan garden in Rohitak 
city. He formally sought for a place of stay suitable for ascetics and stayed there. 
Masses gathered to pay homage and attend his religious discourse. 
Prince Virangad heard the tumultuous noise of the crowd and saw the masses 
going in one direction. Like Jamali, he also went to pay homage to the Acharya and 
after listening to the discourse got inspired to get initiated. Like Jamali he also told 
Acharya Siddharth about his intention of seeking permission from his parents and 
getting initiated. Later he got initiated and became a completely celibate ascetic. 
After that Virangad ascetic lived with Acharya Siddharth and studied eleven 
Angas (the primary canons or the main corpus of the Jain canonical texts) including Samayik. 
After this he led ascetic life for forty five years enkindling his soul by observing a variety 
of austerities including fasting for two or more days. In the end he took the ultimate vow 
(sallekhana) of two month duration, avoiding one hundred and twenty meals embraced 
meditational death after doing pratikraman (critical review) at the moment of his death. He 
reincarnated as a god in ManoramViman (celestialvehicle) in Brahmalok (divinedimension). 
Many gods in that dimension have a life-span of ten Sagaropam (a metaphoric unit of 
time). Lifespan of Virangad god is also said to be10 Sagaropam (a metaphoric unit of time) 
On completing his divine life-span in Brahmalok Kalp that Virangad god has 
descended and reincarnated in this Dvaravati as  son of King Baldev and queen Revati. 
(Before his birth) Queen Revati saw a lion in her dream while she was sleeping in 
her comfortable bed. In due course she gave birth to a son, he matured and was 
married. He spends his life enjoying mundane pleasures in his exclusive mansion. 
0 Vardattv! This is why this Nishadh Kumar has acquired all this opulence of 
human life. 
Ascetic Vardatt again asked—“Bhante ! Does Prince Nishadh have the ability to 
get initiated by you?” Bhagavan Arishtanemi said—“Yes, Vardatt, he has. 
“Bhante ! What you say is, indeed, true.” With these words ascetic Vardatt 
resumed his itinerant way enkindling his soul through austerities and ascetic-discipline.  
In due course Arhat Arishtanemi left Dvaravati and wandered about in other 
inhabited areas. Acquiring the knowledge of fundamentals including the living and the non-
living, Prince Nishadh became a Shramanopasak (a devotee of Shramans). 
Then one day Prince Nishadh came to his Paushadh-shala (place of meditation). He 
sat on a mattress made of hay, took the paushadh vow (partial ascetic vow under which a 
householder lives like an initiated ascetic for a specific period) and commenced meditation. While 
Nishadh was engrossed in meditation, a thought emerged from the depths of his heart—
""Blessed are the inhabitants of those villages, and other inhabited areas where Arhat 
Arishtanemi moves about and also blessed are those kings, princes,... and so on up to... 
caravan chiefs who get the opportunity of paying homage to Arhat Arishtanemi and doing his 
worship. If moving from one village to another, Arhat Arishtanemi comes here in Nandanavan 
I too will get the opportunity of paying homage to Arhat Arishtanemi and doing his worship.""

 Aware of Prince Nishadh's train of thoughts, Arhat Arishtanemi along with his 
eighteen thousand ascetic disciples, moving from one village to another, came to the 
Nandanavan garden in Dvaravati. People came out and moved in the direction of the 
garden to pay homage and obeisance to him. 
Prince Nishadh also got the news of Arhat Arishtanemi's arrival and he was 
pleased and contented. Riding a four-bell chariot he also left, like Jamali, with all his 
grandeur and opulence, to pay homage to Bhagavan. In the end he also took 
permission from his parents, got initiated and became a completely celibate ascetic. 
After getting initiated ascetic Nishadh lived with the senior ascetic disciples of 
Arhat Arishtanemi and studied eleven Angas (the primary canons or the main corpus of the 
Jain canonical texts) including Samayik. After this he led ascetic life for nine years 
enkindling his soul by observing a variety of austerities including fasting for two or more 
days. In the end he took the ultimate vow (sallekhana) of twenty one days duration and 
avoiding forty two meals embraced meditational death after doing pratikraman (critical 
review) at the moment of his death. 
Then realizing that ascetic Nishadh had met his end ascetic Varadatt came to 
Arhat Arishtanemi and conveyed—""Beloved of gods! Where has your noble, simple, and 
humble disciple ascetic Nishadh gone after his death ? Where has he reincarnated? 
Arhat Arishtanemi replied—""Varadatt! My noble, simple, and humble disciple ascetic 
Nishadh lived with my senior ascetic disciples and studied eleven Angas (the primary canons 
or the main corpus of the Jain canonical texts) including Samayik. After this he led ascetic life for 
nine years enkindling his soul by observing a variety of austerities including fasting for two or 
more days. In the end he took the ultimate vow (sallekhana) of twenty one days duration and 
avoiding forty two meals embraced meditational death after doing pratikraman (critical review) 
at the moment of his death. Crossing the stellar dimensions including the moon, the sun, 
planets, constellations and stars; the Achyut dimensions including Saudharm and Ishan; 
the three hundred eighteen Graiveyak Vimans and going even higher he has 
reincarnated as a god in the Sarvarthasiddha Viman (celestial vehicle). Gods in that 
dimension have a life-span of thirty three Sagaropam (a metaphoric unit of time)."" 
On hearing this ascetic Vardatt asked further—""Bhante ! Completing the age, state, 
and life in the dimension of gods and descending from that abode of gods, where will that 
Nishadh Dev go ? (Where will he be born?)"" 
Bhagavan Arishtanemi said, ""Vardatt ! He will be born as a prince in a royal family of a 
noble clan in Unnak city in the Mahavideh area of the Jambudveep continent. Crossing his 
childhood and maturing into youth he will get enlightened by senior ascetics, acquire 
righteous knowledge, renounce his household and get initiated. He will become a completely 
celibate ascetic observing self regulation and other ascetic codes. 
After this he will lead ascetic life for many years enkindling his soul by observing a variety 
of unusual austerities including fasting for one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, or ten 
days, a fortnight or a month. Then he will purify his soul by observing the ultimate vow 
(sallekhana) of month long duration avoiding sixty meals. During this period he will follow all the 
codes including sleeping on a plank, reclining and sitting on wood and hay, pulling out hair, 
remaining celibate, entering houses of others to seek alms, living only on whatever alms are

offered, enduring pricks of pleasant and unpleasant words piercing the sense organs, 
etc. in order to attain the goal for which he had become unclad (detached), got tonsured 
(physically and mentally), abandoning bathing, brushing of teeth, using umbrella and shoes. 
Observing these codes, in his last breath, he will finally become a Siddha (liberated soul) and 
Buddha (enlightened) ending all miseries.""
